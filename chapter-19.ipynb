    "\n",
    "In the previous chapters we discussed how we can use data to test hypotheses. This approach gives us p-values, which we can use to decide if we think it is likely or not that the true effect or model in a population is 0. But that sort of decision is ultimately a binary answer: we either reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis. We neglect a lot of the information a model gives us if p-values are the only thing we pay attention to. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following situation. You are testing the efficacy of a new drug for treating depression, and find that the effect of the drug has a p-value of <0.01. Taking the drug significantly improves depression! In a simple world, that would be all you need to send the drug into production and start selling it to people. However, we don't live in a simple world. It takes money and time to produce medicine, which are resources taken away from producing other things. Your bosses (and the taxpayers funding Medicare) want that money and time to be worth it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course it's worth it you say, because the effect is signfificant! But what if you learned that the actual *amount* the drug improved depression by was 1 point on a 10 point scale? Is that worth it? What if it instead improved depression by only 0.1 points? What if it improved depression by only a little bit, and also came with side effects like acne and stomach upset? Would you make the same drug production decision across all of these scenarios? \n",
    "\n",
    "We know from our practice with p-values that even tiny effects can be significant if we have enough data. If your only goal is to publish a paper saying that an effect probably exists, then a p-value is enough for that purpose. But if you care about applying your new knowledge in the real world, a p-value doesn't tell us everything. We don't know if the **effect size** is large enough to matter. So while null hypothesis testing tells us whether an effect likely exists in some way (statistical significance), effect sizes tell us how meaningful that effect is (called **practical significance**). Good statistical analyses should report both p-values and effect sizes in order to give the full picture about a statistical model.  "

    "\n",
    "How do you measure an effect size? Throughout this course, we've already been doing it! An effect size is any number expressing the magnitude of an effect. When fitting models, we have interpreted the b coefficients estimated by those models in the context of what difference in predictions we would make for different values of input variables. For a b coefficient of 5, we'd change our prediction of an outcome variable by 5 units for every one unit increase in the predictor variable. For a b coefficient of 0.1, we'd change our outcome prediction only a little bit. These numbers are all effect sizes. They express the size of the effect a predictor variable has on the predictions of an outcome variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, RMSE is an effect size because it tells us the magnitude of prediction errors to expect when using a whole model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The b coefficients and RMSE are specifically known as **unstandardized effect sizes.** An unstandardized effect size is the magnitude of an effect expressed in the units of the variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unstandardized effect sizes are useful for making decisions about particular situations. Drug dose, cholesterol, etc. all having meaningful units by which their quantity is expressed. An unstandardized effect size representing a number in these units tells you how much of a drug you have to give to get an expected outcome, and amount of cholesterol in the blood is well-mapped to heart risks. We interact with the world through the units of quantities, and we best understand effects in these same units.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we have less understanding about domains or measurements that we're not already familiar with. E.g., if a model suggested that drinking alcohol before bed is associated with a decrease in sleep length of 2 hours, we intuitively know what that means. We all sleep, and we've all felt the effects of 8 hours versus 6 hours of sleep. But if that model instead suggested that drinking alcohol before bed is associated with a 2 point decrease in cognitive fluency, what does that mean? What concrete things define cognitive fluency? What does fluency = 5 feel like compared to fluency = 7? What range is it on? \n",
    "\n",
    "Unstandardized coefficients are useful for understanding the practical significance of effects in units that we know about, but are less useful for abstract measurements or domains we are unfamiliar with. In that case, we can standardize the effect size. "

    "## 19.3 Standardized effect sizes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Standardized effect sizes** remove the real-world units from variables. We've done a version of this already when learning about z-scores. A standardized variable is one that has been converted to z-scores. Z-scores, to review, express the value of a variable in terms of how many standard deviations it is away from the variable mean. By doing this, we don't need to have domain expertise in the variable to intrinsically understand what certain values mean. Could you say what a temperature of 350F means relative to other typical temperatures for baking? What about a [Gas mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_mark) of 5? You're likely more familiar with the former than the latter. But if we convert each to z-scores and find that both have a z-score of -1, we can easily undertand either of those values relative to their distribution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A standardized effect size operates similarly. You don't need to know about a variable's units to understand the magnitude of a standardized effect size. Doing this has three benefits for understanding statistical models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Standardized effect sizes help you evaluate how big or small an effect is when the units of measurement aren’t intuitive. We don't have to know the typical range or mean of a variable already in order to interpret a standardized effect size - its value has all the information wrapped into it. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Standardized effect sizes can help you compare results across studies. Many variables are measured on different scales in different studies. This isn’t likely to happen with a variable like temperature, but there are multiple anxiety scales to choose from, each of which is on a different scale. Including standardized effect size statistics can help readers understand trends or differences across studies. It can also help us compare effect sizes of variables in the same model that are measured in different units (although remember we need to use hypothesis testing to figure out if a difference in estimated effect is statistically significant).\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Standardized effect sizes let us plan our research more easily. We'll cover this process more later in this chapter, but the short of it is that there are tools we can use to figure out big of a study we should run if we want to be able to find a particular effect size as statistically significant. These tools use standardized effect sizes.\n",

The complement, then, is we have a 95% chance of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false (P(reject | H<sub>0</sub> is false); true positive)). \n",
    "\n",
    "This concept, the chance of correctly finding an effect that exists in the population, is called **statistical power**. Statistical power, &alpha;, and &beta; are all related, as we can see in this grid: \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/ch19-powergrid.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "For any one study, Type I and Type II error are at odds - lowering the &alpha; criterion to make it harder to get a false positive (rejecting the null when we shouldn't) will raise the chance of getting a false negative (failing to reject the null when we should).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, before even running a study, it is possible to keep both &alpha; and &beta; low. This is because statistical power (1-&beta;) is related to both sample size and effect size. A larger sample size makes our estimates more accurate, and easier to find a small effect significant. A larger effect size is easier to find statistically significant. Thus, when we have a large sample size and a large effect size to find, our statistical power is high for a pre-determined Type I error rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can verify this through simulation. Below is a simulated experiment, comparing the means of two groups. This simulation varied the size of the effect (specified in terms of Cohen’s d), the Type I error rate, and the sample size. This was repeated many times to find the proportion times that the true effect was correctly identified as significant (statistical power). \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/ch19-powersim.png\" width=\"550\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This simulation shows us that for any given Type I error rate we choose, we will have more statistical power if our sample size is large and the effect we are looking to estimate is large. Even if the effect size is small, we will have more power to correctly detect it if we use a big sample size and a more lenient Type I error rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are at least two important reasons to care about statistical power. First, generally we can't control how big an effect is in the population, but we can increase our chance of finding it by designing a study with a large sample size and high statistical power. If we run a study with low statistical power, it will be what is called **underpowered** and we have low hope of correctly finding a significant effect, even if it does exist in the population. Underpowered research is ultimately a waste of money.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, it turns out that any positive findings that come from an underpowered study are more likely to be false compared to a well-powered study. How can this be? Even if we run a study with a small sample size, if we find a significant effect, that would just mean the effect is a large one, right? \n",
    "\n",
    "It's counter-intuitive, but when a research field in general is made up of studies with low power, the chance that any one published study is a false positive is high. This is because it is harder for true positives to be found, but still possible to find false positives. We can use math to demonstrate this explicitly:\n",
    "\n",
    "When we open up a research study reporting an effect, we want to know how likely the results in that study are to be a good reflection of reality - a *true positive*. We want the **positive predictive value** of any one research paper to be high:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$PPV = \\frac{P(true positive)}{P(true positive) + P(false positive)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the proportion of positive results that are true positives. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a research field where many hypotheses are being tested, some are real effects and some are null. There is a probability that any one hypothesis is a true effect (p(effect)) or null (p(null effect)). The probability of finding a true positive result is simply p(effect) multiplied by the statistical power of the study:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(true positive) = P(effect) * (1-\\beta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where &beta; is the Type II error rate. The probability of a false positive result is determined by p(null effect) (1 - p(effect)) and the false positive rate &alpha; \n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(false positive) = (1-P(effect)) * \\alpha$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The positive predictive value of any one published study is then: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$PPV = \\frac{P(effect) * (1-\\beta)}{P(effect) * (1-\\beta) + (1-P(effect)) * \\alpha}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say a research field is pushing the boundaries of knowledge, where most hypotheses that are tested are duds (e.g. p(effect) = 0.2; though note that we don't actually know this number in reality). If the researchers of this field are using a typical Type I error rate of 5% and high power (say, 95% power), we can compute the positive predictive value of any one publication as: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$PPV = \\frac{0.2 * 0.95}{0.2 * 0.95 + (1-0.2) * 0.05} = 0.826$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that any one published paper has an ~83% chance of being a true positive vs. a false positive. \n",
    "\n",
    "But now let's do the same for a research community that doesn't use good power (say, 15% power): \n",
    "\n",
    "$$PPV = \\frac{0.2 * 0.15}{0.2 * 0.15 + (1-0.2) * 0.05} = 0.429$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, any one published study only has a ~43% chance of being a true positive. There are more false positive publications than true positives (and a very large file drawer of true and false negatives that never made it to publication). \n",
    "\n",
    "This realization came crashing down on psychology in the early 2010's when the Open Science Foundation published a [replication report](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aac4716) in which many research teams tried to replicate prior results in the field. Out of 100 unique effects tested, only 36% of them replicated (produced another significant research result). This shocked members of the field and triggered a major crisis of faith, since many of these effects had dozens of earlier papers backing them up. The problem was because that most psychology studies were underpowered, and it turns out research groups had been scrapping many experiments that didn't show a significant result (termed the **file-drawer problem**). This means that, even for the papers that did find a significant effect, the positive predictive value of those papers was low - they were more likely to be false positives than true positives. "

    "Low power is thus a one-two punch to a researcher's efforts. It makes it harder to find an effect that is real in the population, and it also lowers the trustworthiness of results that make it to publication.\n",
