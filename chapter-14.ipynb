    "In all the modeling we've done so far, we've relied on the general *linear* model to combine the effects of predictors in order to make a guess about the value of an outcome. This *linear* keyword means we have combined them with addition in the model equation. It implies that we think each predictor can contribute to explaining variance in the outcome independently, *regardless* of the value of any other predictor. \n",

When women show anger during a problem, they are conferred less workplace status and may even be punished for it (\"she's being irrational\").

    "## 14.2 Specifying an interaction model\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's review multivariable models, and then learn the differece between specifying main effects versus interactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that there is a drug being tested in a clinical trial to reduce cholesterol. Suppose we are expecting a linear dose-response effect such that the higher the dose of the drug, the less cholesterol someone has:\n",
    " \n",
    "<img src=\"images/ch14-lineardrug.png\" width=\"450\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, however, suppose that male subjects have an overall higher level of cholesterol compared to female subjects, but that the drug will still help both groups of subjects in the same way. In this situation, graph may look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/ch14-maineffectdrug.png\" width=\"450\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the independent multivariable situation we have worked with before. Both of these effects are main effects because the effect is present and the same strength no matter the value of the other variable. The **simple slope** lines (the regression line for just one sex condition) have the same slope, and there is always the same distance between predicted values of cholesterol for male and female subjects no matter the drug dose.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, maybe male and female subjects actually react differently to the drug dosage, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/ch14-interactiondrug1.png\" width=\"450\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In this situation, being female makes the drug work better. There is a steeper simple slope for female subjects, such that a 1-unit increase in drug dosage results in a larger drop in cholesterol than the same 1-unit increase in drug dosage for male subjects.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if the drug works less well in female subjects, they would have a shallower dose-response line compared to male subjects, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/ch14-interactiondrug2.png\" width=\"450\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Of these four graphs, the first indicates no difference in cholesterol between male and female subjects - there is only an effect of drug dose. This is a simple linear regression with one predictor. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second graph illustrates that there is a difference in cholesterol between male and female subjects and also an expected change in cholesterol level for each 1-unit increase in drug dose. But these effects do not influence each other - taking an increasingly stronger drug will help male and female subjects the same amount. There are only main effects of drug dose and sex. \n",
    "\n",
    "The third and fourth graphs represent situations with an interaction. The effect of drug dose (the slope of the regression line) changes depending on the value of another variable, sex. In this case, the change in predicted cholesterol for every one-unit increase of the drug dose depends on whether it is given to male or female subjects. \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of regression equations, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simple regression, main effect of dose:** \n",
    "\n",
    "$$cholesterol_i = b_0 + b_1dose_i + e_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Y$ represents the outcome (amount of cholesterol), $b_0$ is the expected cholesterol when dose = 0, and $b_1$ is the expected difference in cholesterol for every one-unit increase in drug dose.\n",

The dose and sex components are included linearly in this equation - they are added together. By doing this, we are hypothesizing that the effect of dose is the same regardless of sex, and vice versa. \n",
    "\n",
    "To write an equation for the situation with an interaction, we need a way to modify the strength of the effect of dose depending on what sex value someone has. In this way, someone who is male can have a different effect of dose than someone who is female.\n",

    "Remember that the coefficient $b$ is the effect of a variable. We multiply it by the value of the variable to create predictions.

It's any situation where you might say \"it depends\" for making predictions. Is sun exposure related to skin cancer risk? It depends on if you're wearing sunscreen or not. Does adding more mustard make food more tasty? It depends on if that food is a hot dog or ice cream (or maybe not - you do you.) "

    "## 14.3 Interpreting the parameter estimates \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this interaction between the variables, interpreting the coefficients gets tricky. If the equation looked specifically like: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$cholesterol_i = 40 - 0.5dose_i + 12sex_i - 0.25dose_i*sex_i + e_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "you should interpret $b_0$, $b_1$, and $b_2$ in the contexts of when the other variable is 0. Here: \n",
    "- $b_0$ (the intercept) is the expected cholesterol when dose = 0 and sex = 0. If \"female\" is the reference group, then this would be the expected cholesterol for someone who is female and who has not received any drug. \n",
    "- $b_1$ (the main effect of dose) is the expected change in cholesterol for every one-unit increase in dose, *when sex = 0* (i.e., for the reference group of female). \n",
    "- $b_2$ (the main effect of sex) is the expected change in cholesterol when you cross from the female to male category, *when dose = 0*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's get to $b_3$ (the interaction coefficient). Think of this as the change in a *main effect*, for every one-unit increase of another variable. For our case, when males and females have not received any drug, males are expected to have 12 units more cholesterol than females ($b_2 = 12$). But for every one-unit increase in dose, the difference in cholesterol between females and males is expected to decrease by 0.25 ($b_3$ = -0.25). Male subjects start with higher predicted cholesterol for the same dose of the drug, but as the drug dose increases they will eventualy be predicted to have a lower cholesterol level than female subjects. In this perspective, we would consider drug dose to be a **moderator** of the effect of sex. The dose of the drug is changing the difference between sex groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the pictures above, a negative interaction term means the distance between lines for levels 0 and 1 of the sex variable is shrinking (or flipping negative) as you move up the x-axis. A positive interaction term means the distance between lines for levels 0 and 1 is growing (or flipping positive) as you move up the x-axis. The magnitude of the interaction term describes the speed at which that is happening. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also interpret an interaction coefficient the other way around: by switching consideration from female to male subjects, we expect the difference in cholestrol between a dose of 0 and a dose of 1 to be 0.25 less. I.e., the simple slope of male subjects is 0.25 less than the simple slope of female subjects (since female subjects have a negative slope, this means the male subject line has an even more negative slope). In this perspective, we would consider sex to be a moderator of the effect of drug dose. The sex of a participant is changing the effect of the drug. When building interaction models, it doesn't matter which variable you consider to be the moderator. Just make sure you interpret the meaning of the coefficient correctly depending on what you choose.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Coefficient interpretation is more complicated for interaction models than main effect models. And it takes a lot of words to write out. But it's important to practice fully writing out what you expect to happen to your predictions under different values of the explanatory variables in concrete terms, not just saying things like \"negative interaction effect between dose and sex.\" That statement is removed from the units and real-world meaning of the variables. When interpreting coefficients, we want to stay as close to the real units as we can so that we keep sight of how important these prediction changes are in a practical sense."

    "## 14.4 Interactions between two categorical variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do some more interpretation practice, this time with the study that we opened this chapter with - emotion and gender interacting to determine how much status someone is conferred at work.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, the researchers gave participants vignette stories about the ways hypothetical people reacted to a problem at work. In these stories, the gender and emotion of the target person varied. This target was either portrayed as a man or a woman, and their reaction was described as either one of anger or one of sadness. Participants were then asked several questions about how much status, power, hiring potential, and independence the target deserved at work (all combined into one outcome variable, \"status conferral\", ranging from 1 to 11). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the outcome variable is how much status participants think the target should be conferred. There are two predictor variables - target's gender and target's emotion. Both of these predictors are categorical, because they represent qualitatively different categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we've learned in previous chapters, there is no difference in the form of the statistical equation when using categorical vs. quantitative predictor variables. All that changes is the interpretation of the coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say the best-fitting equation for this study is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$status_i = 3.7 + 2.5gender_i + 1.2reaction_i - 3.4gender_i*reaction_i + e_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Visually, this would look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/ch14-reactionmod.png\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand what each coefficient means, start with the simplest situation, when the value of every variable is 0 (in this case, the reference group for both predictors). If the reference group of gender is \"female\" and the reference group of emotion is \"anger\" (the blue bar on the left), then putting those values into the equation would reduce it to $status_i = 3.7$. That means we would predict a status value of 3.7 for targets who are female and react with anger. This is the predicted outcome value for a target in both reference groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's change one of the variable values, but leave the other at 0. For instance, what is the predicted status value for a male who reacts with anger? Inserting 1 for the value of gender and 0 for the value of emotion would make the equation $status_i = 3.7 + 2.5 = 6.2$. Males who react with anger (blue bar on the right) are predicted to be rated with a value of 6.2 for their status. The value $b_1 = 2.5$ thus means the predicted difference in status for women and men when in the emotion reference group (emotion = 0; anger). Since this coefficient is positive, that means men (gender = 1) are conferred higher status than women (gender = 0) when reacting with anger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's switch the situation, and this time consider a woman (gender = 0) who reacts with sadness (emotion = 1). This equation would reduce to $status_i = 3.7 + 1.2 = 4.9$. Women who react with sadness (orange bar on the left) are predicted to get a status rating of 4.9. Since this $b_2$ coefficient is positive, that means women who react with sadness (emotion = 1) are conferred higher status than women who react with anger (emotion = 0). \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, consider the situation for a man (gender = 1) who reacts with sadness (emotion = 1). Neither of these predictor values are 0, so we have to use the full equation: $status_i = 3.7 + 2.5 + 1.2 - 3.4 = 4$. Men who react with sadness are conferred a status level of 4. Since this $b_3$ coefficient is negative, we need to interpret it as one variable moderating the effect of the other in such a way that decreases the value of that effect. If we think about emotional reaction as the moderator, this means the simple slope for men is 3.4 more negative than the simple slope for females. If we think about gender as the moderator, this means the simple slope for sadness is 3.4 more negative than for anger. \n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on which variable you choose as the moderator, it can be helpful to plot that as different lines: \n",

    "\n",
    "Visualization helps us see the meaning of the interaction effect. We can see what the simple slopes are within one value of the moderator, and we can see that the bigger the difference in these slopes, the stronger the interaction effect is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizing interactions also helps us see that there are different *kinds* of interactions. First, in **attenuation interactions**, the direction of the simple effect in each level of the moderator is the same. We saw an example of an attenuation interaction in the dose/sex interaction of the cholesterol data. Even though the effect of the drug dose was weaker in female subjects than male subjects, the slope of the effect of drug dose for both groups was still negative. Overall, increasing drug dose is associated with reduced cholesterol. It's just that in female subjects, the strength of this effect is weaker or attenuated compared to the effect in male subjects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another kind of interaction is a **knock-out interaction**. Imagine a scenario where you had test subjects stand outside for up to an hour, either wearing or not wearing sunscreen. If we plotted the interaction between minutes outside and sunscreen wearing on amount of sunburn subjects received, we'd see a positive relationship between minutes outside and amount of sunburn for participants without suncreen. This simple slope would be positive. But for the sunscreen group (if they had a sufficient SPF of course), there would be no difference in their sunburn levels no matter how many minutes they were outside. In other words, there would be no effect of time spent outside on sunburn levels; the effect was \"knocked out\" by putting on sunscreen. The simple slope in this group would be a flat line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there are **crossover interactions**. This is a situation like the interaction between target gender and target reaction in the Brescoll & Uhlmann (2008) data. In a crossover interaction, the impact of including a moderator is that the direction of the effect flips. While men receive less status when expressing sadness vs. anger (a negative slope in the above plot), women receive more status when expressing sadness vs. anger (a positive slope in the above plot). There is an effect of emotion reaction in both gender categories, but the effect is opposite. \n",

    "\n",
    "In just a few chapters, we've learned about so many model forms - simple group model, simple regression, multivariable models, and now interaction models. It may start to feel overwhelming to know what model structure you should choose for any particular research question. \n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, it is not an easy task. We are trying to understand the data generation process as best we can, in terms of what explanatory variables are included and how they relate to an outcome, but human psychology is very complex and we're almost never sure about what the best model truly is. Is there an interaction? Should you control for something? Researchers argue over these details every day. It's important that you understand the breadth of available models, and some are more obviously wrong than others, but choosing the absolute best one is a difficult feat. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to get comfortable with not always being right, and with having opinions that are different than other people. To pick a model structure to work with, start with what you think makes the most sense given what you already know about the topic you are trying to study. Then collect some data, evaluate how right or wrong you are, and update your theories accordingly. This is how science advances.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have a strong idea about the true data generation process, you may be tempted to fit many different versions of a model and then compare the amount of error in each one. After all, that's how we were comparing models in this very chapter. However, we did that here just for demonstration purposes. As it turns out, practices like testing many models with the same data and picking the best one based on what *that sample of data* tells you is a form of overfitting, and leads to conclusions that don't replicate in other data samples. This is part of what lead to the [Replication Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis) in psychology. \n",
    "\n",
    "To compare models more robustly, there are some techniques you can practice. If you have an idea about what the likely best model is, you can **preregister** that idea. A preregistration is when you write down, ideally somewhere public like the repository of the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/), what you plan to do in your research and what model specification you are going to test. That way, you can't hide from when your model is maybe not as good as you were hoping. You have to face whether or not this performance refutes your hypotheses, rather than making up a new hypothesis in light of the data and claiming you were right all along (this is a bad practice called HARKing - Hypothesizing After Results are Known). \n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have a strong hypothesis yet and you're not ready to preregister, you can do what's called **exploratory analysis**. This is when you do test out many models to see which has the best fit in some data. But, you can't stop there. At this point, you wouldn't know if your best model is a good reflection of the true data generation process, or just overfit for this dataset in particular. The next step is to then do **confirmatory analysis** with a new, fresh set of data. That way, you can investigate if your model replicates and still has good performance no matter the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "If your dataset is large enough, you can do both exploratory and confirmatory analysis without running a whole new study. You can split your data in half, find the best fitting model in one half, then replicate that model in the other half. If your replication is pretty similar to the original performance in the first half, you've successfully avoided overfitting. "

    "\n",
    "After reading this chapter, you should be able to: \n",
    "- Understand the difference between main effects and interactions\n",
    "- Interpret coefficients in an interaction model no matter the predictor type\n",
    "- Fit an interaction model in R\n",
    "- Plot an interaction model\n",
    "- Identify different types of interactions based on a visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "## New concepts\n",
    "- **main effect** - An effect of a variable in a model of the data generation process that is unaffected by values on other variables. \n",
    "- **interaction** - If the effect of one predictor variable depends on values of another variable, there is an interaction between those variables in the data generation process. \n",
    "- **moderator** - A variable whose value changes the effect of another variable. \n",
    "- **simple slope** - A regression line indicating the effect of a predictor for just one value of another predictor variable. \n",
    "- **attenuation interaction** - A type of interaction where the magnitude of the effect of one predictor changes for different values of a moderator, but the qualitative direction of that effect is the same (e.g. positive or negative association between predictor and outcome).\n",
    "- **knock-out interaction** - A type of interaction where there is an effect of a predictor for some values of a moderator, but that effect disappears for other values of the moderator. \n",
    "- **cross-over interaction** - A type of interaction where the direction of the effect of a predictor (positive or negative) changes depending on the value of a moderator. \n",
    "- **preregistration** - A public record of your research plans, published before doing any analyses. \n",
    "- **exploratory analysis** - The process of checking for many possible associations in some data without a pre-existing hypothesis. \n",
    "- **confirmatory analysis** - The process of testing whether data support or refute a specific hypothesis regarding the data generation process.\n",
