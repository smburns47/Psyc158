    "# Chapter 3 - Organizing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Last chapter we discussed different types of data and had you practice representing them in R. You did this by writing out data values in vectors, essentially making the data up. However, real data comes from somewhere else - a study you run, an open-source repository, etc. In addition, data usually consists of more than one variable at once, stored together in a **dataset**. In this chapter we will get familiar with how to store and access datasets in files, and how to manage a much larger amount of data than we've so far worked with. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.1 The structure of data \n",
    "\n",
    "Data can come to us in many forms. If you collect data yourself, you may start out with numbers written on scraps of paper. Or you may get a computer file filled with numbers and words of various sorts, representing many variables at once. \n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have worked with one variable at a time, which is easy to visualize and understand simply by printing its vector. However, most real-world data has many variables stored at once. To manage this, it is necessary to organize and format data so that they are easy to analyze using statistical software. There is no one way to organize data, but there is a way that is most common, and that is what we recommend you use.\n",
    "\n",
    "This common way is called a **data frame**. Under this framework, data are stored into rectangular tables, with rows and columns. What goes on each row and column follows four principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each column is a variable\n",
    "- Each row is an observation \n",
    "- The first row contains the names of all the variables\n",
    "- The data within a data frame are from the same dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Rectangular tables of this sort are represented in R using a new data type - conveniently, called a data frame. It is a rectangular matrix as described above, with columns as variables and rows as the cases sampled. Each value of different variables that are on the same row belong to the same observation (e.g., the same person, zip code, habitat, etc.) Data frames provide a way to save information such as column headings (i.e., variable names) in the same table as the actual data values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Principle 4 above simply states that the types of observations that form the rows cannot be mixed within a single table. So, for example, you wouldn’t have rows of college students intermixed with rows of cars or countries or couples. If you have a mix of observation types (e.g., students, families, countries), they each go in a different data frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.2 Creating a data frame\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combining vectors\n",
    "Let's see how we create and work with data frames in R. Say we have two vectors, ```x1 <- c(1,2,3,4,5)``` and ```x2 <- c(18,21,20,23,20)```. We can combine these together into one data frame object using the ```data.frame()``` function."

    "## 3.3 Importing existing data\n",
    "\n",
    "The vast majority of the time in data analysis, you are not manually creating vectors and data frames (except when you are doing data simulations - we'll talk more about that in Chapter 8). Instead, you are importing an existing file of data. So for the rest of this chapter we're going to practice working with and understanding an example dataset from a study by [James et al. (2015)](https://journals.sagepub.com/stoken/default+domain/hQ2W4fbPrZVJ7eyNJaqu/full), on how playing Tetris may limit intrusive traumatic memories. In this study, 72 participants watched a traumatic video and were then put into one of four experimental conditions designed to test how often intrusive memories happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have experience opening datasets in programs like Excel with an .xlsx extension. The extension tells you what kind of file format it is - .xlsx, for example, is an excel file. There are many file formats data can be saved in that are more or less easy to open in various software. Our Tetris Memories data is saved as a .csv, meaning a \"comma-separated value\" format, as this is really easy for computer programs to parse. If you were to open this file in a basic text editor program, you'd see rows are separated on different lines, and columns are separated by commas. In R, the ```read.csv()``` function can understand this format and create a rectangle dataframe for us. \n",
    "\n",
    "But before we can load our data, R has to know where on your computer it is located. By default, it only looks in what is called your **working directory** - a specific folder on your computer that R treats as its \"home base,\" per se. You can use the function ```getwd()``` to learn what your current working directory is."

In these cases, if you need to do the thing over and over, writing your own function becomes useful.
