<h2>19.1 Statistical vs. practical significance<a class="headerlink" href="#statistical-vs-practical-significance" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>In the previous chapters we discussed how we can use data to test hypotheses. This approach gives us p-values, which we can use to decide if we think it is likely or not that the true effect or model in a population is 0. But that sort of decision is ultimately a binary answer: we either reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis. We neglect a lot of the information a model gives us if p-values are the only thing we pay attention to.</p>
<p>Consider the following situation. You are testing the efficacy of a new drug for treating depression, and find that the effect of the drug has a p-value of &lt;0.01. Taking the drug significantly improves depression! In a simple world, that would be all you need to send the drug into production and start selling it to people. However, we don’t live in a simple world. It takes money and time to produce medicine, which are resources taken away from producing other things. Your bosses (and the taxpayers funding Medicare) want that money and time to be worth it.</p>
<p>Of course it’s worth it you say, because the effect is signfificant! But what if you learned that the actual <em>amount</em> the drug improved depression by was 1 point on a 10 point scale? Is that worth it? What if it instead improved depression by only 0.1 points? What if it improved depression by only a little bit, and also came with side effects like acne and stomach upset? Would you make the same drug production decision across all of these scenarios?</p>
<p>We know from our practice with p-values that even tiny effects can be significant if we have enough data. If your only goal is to publish a paper saying that an effect probably exists, then a p-value is enough for that purpose. But if you care about applying your new knowledge in the real world, a p-value doesn’t tell us everything. We don’t know if the <strong>effect size</strong> is large enough to matter. So while null hypothesis testing tells us whether an effect likely exists in some way (statistical significance), effect sizes tell us how meaningful that effect is (called <strong>practical significance</strong>). Good statistical analyses should report both p-values and effect sizes in order to give the full picture about a statistical model.</p>

<h2>19.2 Unstandardized effect sizes<a class="headerlink" href="#unstandardized-effect-sizes" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>How do you measure an effect size? Throughout this course, we’ve already been doing it! An effect size is any number expressing the magnitude of an effect. When fitting models, we have interpreted the b coefficients estimated by those models in the context of what difference in predictions we would make for different values of input variables. For a b coefficient of 5, we’d change our prediction of an outcome variable by 5 units for every one unit increase in the predictor variable. For a b coefficient of 0.1, we’d change our outcome prediction only a little bit. These numbers are all effect sizes. They express the size of the effect a predictor variable has on the predictions of an outcome variable.</p>
<p>Likewise, RMSE is an effect size because it tells us the magnitude of prediction errors to expect when using a whole model.</p>
<p>The b coefficients and RMSE are specifically known as <strong>unstandardized effect sizes.</strong> An unstandardized effect size is the magnitude of an effect expressed in the units of the variables.</p>
<p>Unstandardized effect sizes are useful for making decisions about particular situations. Drug dose, cholesterol, etc. all having meaningful units by which their quantity is expressed. An unstandardized effect size representing a number in these units tells you how much of a drug you have to give to get an expected outcome, and amount of cholesterol in the blood is well-mapped to heart risks. We interact with the world through the units of quantities, and we best understand effects in these same units.</p>
<p>However, we have less understanding about domains or measurements that we’re not already familiar with. E.g., if a model suggested that drinking alcohol before bed is associated with a decrease in sleep length of 2 hours, we intuitively know what that means. We all sleep, and we’ve all felt the effects of 8 hours versus 6 hours of sleep. But if that model instead suggested that drinking alcohol before bed is associated with a 2 point decrease in cognitive fluency, what does that mean? What concrete things define cognitive fluency? What does fluency = 5 feel like compared to fluency = 7? What range is it on?</p>
<p>Unstandardized coefficients are useful for understanding the practical significance of effects in units that we know about, but are less useful for abstract measurements or domains we are unfamiliar with. In that case, we can standardize the effect size.</p>
</section>
<section id="standardized-effect-sizes">
<h2>19.3 Standardized effect sizes<a class="headerlink" href="#standardized-effect-sizes" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Standardized effect sizes</strong> remove the real-world units from variables. We’ve done a version of this already when learning about z-scores. A standardized variable is one that has been converted to z-scores. Z-scores, to review, express the value of a variable in terms of how many standard deviations it is away from the variable mean. By doing this, we don’t need to have domain expertise in the variable to intrinsically understand what certain values mean. Could you say what a temperature of 350F means relative to other typical temperatures for baking? What about a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_mark">Gas mark</a> of 5? You’re likely more familiar with the former than the latter. But if we convert each to z-scores and find that both have a z-score of -1, we can easily undertand either of those values relative to their distribution.</p>
<p>A standardized effect size operates similarly. You don’t need to know about a variable’s units to understand the magnitude of a standardized effect size. Doing this has three benefits for understanding statistical models:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Standardized effect sizes help you evaluate how big or small an effect is when the units of measurement aren’t intuitive. We don’t have to know the typical range or mean of a variable already in order to interpret a standardized effect size - its value has all the information wrapped into it.</p></li>
<li><p>Standardized effect sizes can help you compare results across studies. Many variables are measured on different scales in different studies. This isn’t likely to happen with a variable like temperature, but there are multiple anxiety scales to choose from, each of which is on a different scale. Including standardized effect size statistics can help readers understand trends or differences across studies. It can also help us compare effect sizes of variables in the same model that are measured in different units (although remember we need to use hypothesis testing to figure out if a difference in estimated effect is statistically significant).</p></li>
<li><p>Standardized effect sizes let us plan our research more easily. We’ll cover this process more later in this chapter, but the short of it is that there are tools we can use to figure out big of a study we should run if we want to be able to find a particular effect size as statistically significant. These tools use standardized effect sizes.</p></li>

<p>Next we will cover how to calculate some of the most common standardized effect statistics.</p>

<h3>Standardized model coefficient<a class="headerlink" href="#standardized-model-coefficient" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>An unstandardized model coefficient is the coefficient estimate a model gives when the model is fit directly onto raw variable values. It is interpreted in the context of those variable units.</p>

<p>When fitting this model, we get a b<sub>0</sub> estimate of 9.2 and a b<sub>1</sub> estimate of 0.388. These mean, in the context of the variable units, that we expect some to have 9.2 years of education if their father had 0 years of education. For every one additional year of education their father had, we’d expect their education to higher by 0.388 years.</p>
<p>A standardized model coefficient, in contrast, is the estimate a model gives when those variables have been z-scored first (NOTE: after removing the rows with NAs on <em>any</em> model variable). The code below will pick out the relevant variables for our model and z-score them all at the same time.</p>

<p>These b estimates are different than before. Now, b<sub>0</sub> = 0.074 and b<sub>1</sub> = 0.538. This is because these coefficients are now in the context of z-scores instead of years of education. We’d interpret these as expecting someone to have an education level that is the mean (z = 0) if their father had a mean amount of education (z = 0), and for that education level to increase by 0.538 SDs for every 1 SD increase in father’s education.</p>
<p>Also notice the difference in p-values between these models. The unstandardized b<sub>0</sub> is significant (p = 2.40e-15), but the standardized b<sub>0</sub> is not (p = 1). This is because the null hypothesis is that β<sub>0</sub> = 0 for both models. In the unstandardized model, 9.2 is a number that is way above 0, and is thus unlikely to be produced by a population unstandardized-β<sub>0</sub> = 0 years. In the standardized model, standardized-β<sub>0</sub> = 0 means unstandardized-β<sub>0</sub> = the mean of of education. A z-score of approximately 0 isn’t different than 0 at all, so we fail to reject that null hypothesis.</p>
<p>However, the p-values of both b<sub>1</sub> estimates are the same. This is because, regardless of the units, the strength of the effect is still the same. There’s no difference in the significance of effect coefficients between a standardized and unstandardized model. This is why you can choose to express the effect size of an estimate in either standardized or unstandardized terms.</p>
<p>Also note that in order to find this standardized b estimate, we have to z-score BOTH the predictor and the outcome. If we only z-scored the predictor and not the outcome, the meaning of the b estimate would be “change in years of education for every 1 SD increase in father’s education.” It would be a sort of half-standardized effect estimate, but we want a fully standardized one in order to compare effect sizes between different analyses and studies.</p>
<p>Another way to convert between unstandardized and standardized bs in the context of simple regression is to use the following formula:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\beta = b * \frac{sd(X)}{sd(Y)}\]</div>
<p>where b is the unstandardized b, and β is the standardized b.</p>
<p>When talking about standardized vs. unstandardizes model coefficients, because they are different numeric values, make sure you are being explicit about which one you are using.</p>

<section id="correlation-coefficient-r">
<h3>Correlation coefficient r<a class="headerlink" href="#correlation-coefficient-r" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>In chapter 12 we learned about the correlation coefficient r. It is frequently used to represent a standardized relationship strength between two continuous variables. It can range from -1 (perfect negative correlation) to 1 (perfect positive correlation), with 0 meaning no relationship.</p>
<p>r is the same thing as the standardized b coefficient from a simple linear model with just one predictor:</p>

<h3>Cohen’s d<a class="headerlink" href="#cohen-s-d" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Standardized b, r, and R<sup>2</sup> are all effect sizes that we have seen and used before. But there are two more measures of effect size that are common to see in psychology research that we haven’t yet encountered.</p>
<p>One of them is called <strong>Cohen’s d</strong>. This measure was created by an influential quantitative psychologist named Jacob Cohen in the 1950s. It is used specifically to represent the magnitude of difference between two categorical groups independent of real-world units. Cohen’s d is related to the concept of z-score, in that it indicates the size of a group mean difference in standard deviation units. It is calculated as:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ d = \frac{\bar{X_1} - \bar{X_2}}{s_{pooled}} \]</div>
<p>s<sub>pooled</sub> is a weighted average of the standard deviations from both groups:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[s_{pooled} = \frac{df_1s_1 + df_2s_2}{df_1 + df_2}\]</div>
<p>Cohen’s d can range between 0 and infinity, but in practice is rarely more than 2. The bigger the d value, the bigger an effect is. To find Cohen’s d in R, first the data from the separate groups need to be saved into two different vectors. Then, you can use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cohensD()</span></code> function in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lsr</span></code> package:</p>

<h3>Cohen’s f<sup>2</sup><a class="headerlink" href="#cohen-s-f-sup-2-sup" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Cohen also came up with something very similar to R<sup>2</sup>, called <strong>Cohen’s f<sup>2</sup></strong> (not to be confused with an F value in an F distribution). Rather than describing the proportion of variation in an outcome that a model explains, Cohen’s f<sup>2</sup> is the ratio of explained to unexplained error:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[f^2 = \frac{R^2}{1-R^2} \]</div>
<p>Rather than being bound between 0 and 1 as R<sup>2</sup> is, f<sup>2</sup> can be as small as 0 and theoretically as large as infinity. A bigger f<sup>2</sup> means a model is explaining more variation. If f<sup>2</sup> is above 1, then the model explains more variation than what is left unexplained. In psychology that is rare but not unheard of.</p>
<p>The above equation is known as the global f<sup>2</sup>, or the f<sup>2</sup> score for a model compared to the empty model. There is also a local f<sup>2</sup> that tells you the increase in explained variation that is attributable to one predictor in the model. The equation for that is:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[f^2 = \frac{R^2_{full} - R^2_{reduced}}{1-R^2_{full}} \]</div>
<p>where R<sup>2</sup><sub>full</sub> is the R<sup>2</sup> of the model with all predictors in it, and R<sup>2</sup><sub>reduced</sub> is the R<sup>2</sup> of a model with all predictors except the one of interest.</p>

<h2>19.4 What is a good effect size?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-a-good-effect-size" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>When evaluating an unstandardized effect size, and when you’re familiar with the units of measurement, you will already have a sense about what an “important” vs. “trivial” effect size is. If you’re studying for a test, 10 hours of studying making a difference of 1% on your grade might not be worth it, but a difference of 10% could be worth spending your whole Saturday in the library.</p>
<p>When you use a standardized effect size, the down side is that you don’t have any real-world units to ground this number in. But the up side is that the same standardized effect size can apply across many research studies. Over time, then, you begin to accumulate a sense for what value of a standardized effect size is “big”, “medium”, or “small.”</p>
<p>When Jacob Cohen first formulated his measurements of d and f<sup>2</sup>, he came up with rules of thumb for what counts as a small, medium, and large effect. He decided that, in general, a “large” effect is one that is obvious - people generally should be able to see this effect in the population, without the need to collect data. This translates to a Cohen’s d of &gt;= 0.8. Something like the difference in height between men and women is a large effect because it is generally possible to see without systematic research, and also has a Cohen’s d &gt; 0.8:</p>

<p>Cohen set a “medium” effect to be one that is 0.5 &lt; d &lt; 0.8. A medium effect should be visible within a representative dataset “to the naked eye of a careful observer.” You might not obviously see it in real life, but if you collect data and plot the histograms of two groups, you’d be able to notice a difference in the histograms.</p>
<p>Finally, a “small” effect is 0.2 &lt; d &lt; 0.5. This is one that you can’t see with the naked eye, but that is still meaningful. It will still matter at the scale of an entire population. Cohen considered any d less than 0.2 to be trivial and not worth studying.</p>
<p>In his 1988 book “Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences”, Cohen also set some general rules of thumb for r, R<sup>2</sup>, and f<sup>2</sup>:</p>

<p>However, in practice it is best to remember that these are just guidelines. A large effect might not be very trustworthy if you found it in a small sample, and a tiny effect might still be theoretically important (e.g., it’s not a great predictor on its own but significantly contributes to a larger model). It is better to be aware of the wider field of study you are working in, what the typical effect sizes are, and how your measured effect size compares to those. For instance, it is pretty rare to find large effects in psychology research (most of those have been published already!). A lot of modern work is on the little effects that give the data generation process nuance.</p>

<section id="statistical-power">
<h2>19.5 Statistical power<a class="headerlink" href="#statistical-power" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Effect sizes and statistical significance are not the same thing - you can’t tell what an effect size is just from a p-value, and you can’t tell whether an effect is significant just by looking at an effect size. But these two things cooperate for helping us make conclusions about models. In fact, they balance each other.</p>
<p>Recall in chapter 17 when we discussed Type I and Type II error. Type I error is the chance that we mistakenly reject the null hypothesis when it is in fact true. We thought that there’s a non-zero effect, but really there’s nothing there. We set this chance ourselves, with an α criterion of 0.05. α = 0.05 means there is a 95% chance we fail to reject the null when it is true (P(fail to reject | H<sub>0</sub> is true); true negative), and a 5% chance we incorrectly reject the null when it is true (P(reject | H<sub>0</sub> is true); false positive). α is the Type I error rate - given the null is true, how often do we get a false positive decision?</p>
<p>On the other hand is Type II error. This is the chance that we fail to reject the null hypothesis when we should have. Like Type I error is controlled by a criterion that we set, Type II also has a criterion β (not to be confused with the population model parameter β… I guess we were running out of letters to use for things). When we set the β criterion to something like 0.05, we would have a 5% chance of failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false (P(fail to reject | H<sub>0</sub> is false); false negative). The complement, then, is we have a 95% chance of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false (P(reject | H<sub>0</sub> is false); true positive)).</p>
<p>This concept, the chance of correctly finding an effect that exists in the population, is called <strong>statistical power</strong>. Statistical power, α, and β are all related, as we can see in this grid:</p>
<img src="images/ch19-powergrid.png" width="500">
<p>For any one study, Type I and Type II error are at odds - lowering the α criterion to make it harder to get a false positive (rejecting the null when we shouldn’t) will raise the chance of getting a false negative (failing to reject the null when we should).</p>
<p>However, before even running a study, it is possible to keep both α and β low. This is because statistical power (1-β) is related to both sample size and effect size. A larger sample size makes our estimates more accurate, and easier to find a small effect significant. A larger effect size is easier to find statistically significant. Thus, when we have a large sample size and a large effect size to find, our statistical power is high for a pre-determined Type I error rate.</p>
<p>We can verify this through simulation. Below is a simulated experiment, comparing the means of two groups. This simulation varied the size of the effect (specified in terms of Cohen’s d), the Type I error rate, and the sample size. This was repeated many times to find the proportion times that the true effect was correctly identified as significant (statistical power).</p>
<img src="images/ch19-powersim.png" width="550">
<p>This simulation shows us that for any given Type I error rate we choose, we will have more statistical power if our sample size is large and the effect we are looking to estimate is large. Even if the effect size is small, we will have more power to correctly detect it if we use a big sample size and a more lenient Type I error rate.</p>
<p>There are at least two important reasons to care about statistical power. First, generally we can’t control how big an effect is in the population, but we can increase our chance of finding it by designing a study with a large sample size and high statistical power. If we run a study with low statistical power, it will be what is called <strong>underpowered</strong> and we have low hope of correctly finding a significant effect, even if it does exist in the population. Underpowered research is ultimately a waste of money.</p>
<p>Second, it turns out that any positive findings that come from an underpowered study are more likely to be false compared to a well-powered study. How can this be? Even if we run a study with a small sample size, if we find a significant effect, that would just mean the effect is a large one, right?</p>
<p>It’s counter-intuitive, but when a research field in general is made up of studies with low power, the chance that any one published study is a false positive is high. This is because it is harder for true positives to be found, but still possible to find false positives. We can use math to demonstrate this explicitly:</p>
<p>When we open up a research study reporting an effect, we want to know how likely the results in that study are to be a good reflection of reality - a <em>true positive</em>. We want the <strong>positive predictive value</strong> of any one research paper to be high:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[PPV = \frac{P(true positive)}{P(true positive) + P(false positive)}\]</div>
<p>This is the proportion of positive results that are true positives.</p>
<p>In a research field where many hypotheses are being tested, some are real effects and some are null. There is a probability that any one hypothesis is a true effect (p(effect)) or null (p(null effect)). The probability of finding a true positive result is simply p(effect) multiplied by the statistical power of the study:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[P(true positive) = P(effect) * (1-\beta)\]</div>
<p>where β is the Type II error rate. The probability of a false positive result is determined by p(null effect) (1 - p(effect)) and the false positive rate α</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[P(false positive) = (1-P(effect)) * \alpha\]</div>
<p>The positive predictive value of any one published study is then:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[PPV = \frac{P(effect) * (1-\beta)}{P(effect) * (1-\beta) + (1-P(effect)) * \alpha}\]</div>
<p>Let’s say a research field is pushing the boundaries of knowledge, where most hypotheses that are tested are duds (e.g. p(effect) = 0.2; though note that we don’t actually know this number in reality). If the researchers of this field are using a typical Type I error rate of 5% and high power (say, 95% power), we can compute the positive predictive value of any one publication as:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[PPV = \frac{0.2 * 0.95}{0.2 * 0.95 + (1-0.2) * 0.05} = 0.826\]</div>
<p>This means that any one published paper has an ~83% chance of being a true positive vs. a false positive.</p>
<p>But now let’s do the same for a research community that doesn’t use good power (say, 15% power):</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[PPV = \frac{0.2 * 0.15}{0.2 * 0.15 + (1-0.2) * 0.05} = 0.429\]</div>
<p>Now, any one published study only has a ~43% chance of being a true positive. There are more false positive publications than true positives (and a very large file drawer of true and false negatives that never made it to publication).</p>
<p>This realization came crashing down on psychology in the early 2010’s when the Open Science Foundation published a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aac4716">replication report</a> in which many research teams tried to replicate prior results in the field. Out of 100 unique effects tested, only 36% of them replicated (produced another significant research result). This shocked members of the field and triggered a major crisis of faith, since many of these effects had dozens of earlier papers backing them up. The problem was because that most psychology studies were underpowered, and it turns out research groups had been scrapping many experiments that didn’t show a significant result (termed the <strong>file-drawer problem</strong>). This means that, even for the papers that did find a significant effect, the positive predictive value of those papers was low - they were more likely to be false positives than true positives.</p>

<h2>19.7 Power planning<a class="headerlink" href="#power-planning" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Low power is thus a one-two punch to a researcher’s efforts. It makes it harder to find an effect that is real in the population, and it also lowers the trustworthiness of results that make it to publication.</p>
<p>The solution to this is to ensure ahead of time that your study design will have enough power. This process is called <strong>power planning</strong>.</p>
<p>Recall that these four things are related to each other:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>statistical power</p></li>
<li><p>sample size</p></li>
<li><p>Type I error rate</p></li>
<li><p>effect size</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you know three of these values, you can compute the fourth.</p>
<p>One version of power planning is called <strong>sensitivity analysis</strong>. It asks, given a chosen Type I error rate and sample size, what is the smallest effect size you are well-powered to find.</p>
<p>A good tool for doing power planning is the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pwr</span></code> package in R. With it, you can enter three of the four values above, and it will tell you the fourth. Let’s use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pwr.r.test()</span></code> function in that package for an analysis where we plan to find a correlation between two variables. This function has four arguments:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">n</span></code>, the planned sample size</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">r</span></code>, the effect size r</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sig.level</span></code>, the Type I error rate</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">power</span></code>, the desired power level.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To use this function, three out of four of these arguments must be set with a value, and the fourth one assigned a value of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NULL</span></code>. Whichever value is set to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NULL</span></code> will be computed based on the other three.</p>
<p>If we use a Type I error rate of 5%, a sample size of 50, and want to have at least 80% power (the modern standard of power for research studies), what is the smallest r correlation that we will have an 80% chance of finding?</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">
<div class="highlight-r notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nf">install.packages</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;pwr&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The result of this sensitivity analysis says that, with a sample size of 50 and Type I error rate of 5%, we have 80% power to detect an effect as small as r=0.38. If the true effect in the population is smaller than that, we are underpowered to detect it.</p>
<p>Now use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pwr.r.test()</span></code> function yourself to run a sensitivity analysis for a study with n=80, significance level 0.05, and power level of 0.8.</p>

<p>Another type of power planning we can do is <strong>sample size planning</strong>. If we want to be able to detect an r=0.2 with 80% power, what sample size do we need to do that?</p>

<p>We would need about 193 people in our research study in order to find a significant effect of r=0.2.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pwr</span></code> has functions for different sorts of effect sizes. For instance, to plan the sample size for detecting a total model f<sup>2</sup> score, we would use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pwr.f2.test()</span></code>. This one takes five arguments:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">u</span></code>, the number of variable coefficients to estimate (k-1)</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">v</span></code>, the degrees of freedom (N-k)</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">f2</span></code>, the effect size f<sup>2</sup></p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sig.level</span></code>, the Type I error rate</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">power</span></code>, the desired power level.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What sample size do we need to detect an f<sup>2</sup> score of 0.1 in a model with two predictors?</p>

<p>We would need about 96 degrees of freedom in our study. Since we are estimating coefficients for 2 predictors (a three-parameter model), that means 96 + 3 = 99 people to recruit.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pwr</span></code> doesn’t have a function for d or R<sup>2</sup>. but for d, r, R<sup>2</sup>, and f<sup>2</sup>, you can actually convert between these values since they’re all ultimately built on sum of squares. To go between d and r, you can use the following equations:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[r = \frac{d}{\sqrt{d^2 + h}}\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ d = \frac{r\sqrt{h}}{\sqrt{1-r^2}}\]</div>
<p>where h is an equation to take into account the sizes of two separate groups:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ h = \frac{n_1 + n_2 - 2}{n_1} + \frac{n_1 + n_2 - 2}{n_2}\]</div>
<p>R<sup>2</sup> is, of course, the square of r. And, as discussed above, the following equations can take you between R<sup>2</sup> and f<sup>2</sup>:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[f^2 = \frac{R^2}{1-R^2}\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[R^2 = \frac{f^2}{1+f^2}\]</div>
<p>A big question for power planning is what sort of effect size should we plan for? If a sensitivity analysis says we can detect down to r=0.38, is that a good thing or do we need to power for something lower?</p>
<p>This sort of question could be answered two ways. One, what is the smallest effect size that would matter to you? What do you consider to be a meaningful effect, and what would be too trivial to deal with? You could use Cohen’s rules of thumb for this, or your own expertise in the research domain for what kind of effect size is worth the trouble of an intervention.</p>
<p>The second way to answer this is, what effect sizes have other researchers found in related studies? You might expect your effect size to be similar to theirs, so you can power plan with that sort of effect size in mind.</p>
<p>If you don’t have an idea about a smallest effect size of interest and there isn’t a guide from prior research about what you should expect, you can run a pilot study to collect some data and estimate an effect size. A pilot study generally has few data points and thus unstable estimates, but here you’re not worried about a significant effect yet. You can find the confidence interval of an estimate in this pilot study, perhaps choose an effect value that is on the lower end of that interval, and then power plan for a full study with that effect size as a target.</p>
