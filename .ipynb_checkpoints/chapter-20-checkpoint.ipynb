    "# Chapter 20 - Alternate Approaches - Traditional Statistical Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "## 20.1 Different teaching philosophies\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course you have spent a long time learning about how to make predictions and do inference with the general linear model. However, most statistics students don't learn this framework for doing analysis. Instead, they learn an assortment of different statistical procedures like the t-test, ANOVA, chi-square, etc. Indeed many practicing researchers also use these tools instead of the GLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "So why learn the GLM at all if not as many people use it? There are two pedagogical reasons for why this course emphasized this method instead of the traditional content:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Traditional tools require learning how to do hypothesis testing first** - Traditional methods fundamentally depend on Null Hypothesis Significance testing. They cannot be interpreted without setting a null hypothesis, computing a t/F score, and finding a p-value. This means to learn how to use these tools, students first have to learn about sampling distributions and significance testing. This is a rather abstract thing to learn first and impedes understanding for many people. This leads them to using intellectual short cuts like \"always look for p < 0.05\" despite the dangers of overrelying on that number. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Traditional tools are more variable, harder to remember** - When first starting out, the list of all the common statistical tools often seems daunting. They are calculated all different ways with different names and it's hard to remember what goes where. In contrast, the GLM is ultimatly one tool - $Y_i = b_0 + b_1X_i + e_i$. How many predictors you add to the equation and how you interpret the coefficients varies depending on your use situation, but just knowing about this one equation gets you 80% of the way there, making it a better starting point for building conceptual understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the advantages of the GLM however, many people still use the traditional tools. Thus, it is good for you to be able to identify them and understand how they map onto what you have learned with the GLM. Ultimately, the GLM and these tools will give you the same answer and you can choose which you prefer in your own research. Knowing both will enable you to read and understand research reports no matter what method the authors used. "
