    "# Chapter 10 - Quantifying Error in a Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember how in chapter 5, we talked about what makes a \"better\" measure of central tendency, the mean or median? This is how we are defining \"better\" - lower error when we use that statistic as the model for the data distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Statisticians tend to model unexplained variation, whether real or induced by data collection, as though it were generated by a random process (e.g., uniform, or normal, or some other probability distribution). They do this because this helps them make some progress. It is easy to predict what unexplained variation might look like if the DGP is random. Then they can compare what they predicted, assuming a random process, with what the data distribution actually looks like."
