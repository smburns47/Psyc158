    "important to keep the coefficient in mind, don't just look at p-value. Even though we can't be sure of the true population parameter, the range of parameters likely to give us this data have meaning for making real world decisions. If giving someone a psychiatric drug with a lot of side effects will improve depression by [1.1 to 1.3], is that worth the side effects? What if it improved depression by [0.01 to 0.03]? Commonly referred to as **practical significance** \n",
