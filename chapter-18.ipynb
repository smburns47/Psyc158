    "\n",
    "Last chapter we introduced the idea of significance testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal of evaluating whether a certain predictor's effect is significantly different from 0 - whether it is unlikely to not add predictive value \n",
    "\n",
    "- using p-values to evaluate specific effects in each type of model\n",
    "- simple models, multivariable models (controlling), interaction models\n",
    "- pairwise comparisons for group models (Coursekata 10.8) \n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter we learned how to use the sampling distribution of &beta; to test the null hypothesis. Using permutation testing, we generated a sampling distribution for a world in which &beta; = 0 is true in the data generation process. We used the sampling distribution to calculate the p-value, the probability that the sample b, or a b more extreme than the sample, would have occurred just by chance if the null hypothesis were true. Based on the p-value, and the decision criterion we had set (i.e., &alpha; of .05), we decided whether to reject the null hypothesis or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decisions of statistical significance are made about one statistical estimate at a time. Thus, it is a common tool for psychologists who are interested in questions such as \"is *this* effect a real part of the data generation process?\" Let's explore in more concrete detail how to use them to answer psychological research questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Effects in the simple model\n",
    "Returning back to the General Social Survey dataset we encountered earlier, one hypothesis we had was whether parents' education level explains some of the variation in a person's own education level. A research question like this implies that we are interested in the predictor \"parents' education\" specifically, and its unique contribution to predictions about own education. We recognize that there are likely many factors that lead to how much schooling someone goes through, and we may even know some more of them and be able to model them as well. But our interests focus on how important parents' education level is specifically in the data generation process. Is it a meaningful contributor to explaining variation in own education? Or is there not really an effect? \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the framework of Null Hypothesis Statistical Testing, we can answer this sort of question. We just have to put the question into terms that make sense in the NHST. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to pick the variables we're using to test this question. We'll use the outcome variable ```highest_year_of_school_completed``` from the GSS, and we'll use specifically the mother's education level to predict it - ```highest_year_school_completed_mother```. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we need to formulate the null hypothesis. We think that mother's education is interesting if it predicts some variation in a participant's education - that there is a relationship between the two. That implies that there would be a non-zero coefficient for mother's education in a linear model. It would *not* be an interesting variable if there was no change in predicted participant education when mother's education varied - i.e., if the coefficient were 0. Thus, we define the null hypothesis to be: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$H_0: b_1 = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where b<sub>1</sub> is the coefficient for mother's education in the linear model. In a world where the true population parameter &beta;<sub>1</sub> is 0, where there is no real effect of mother's education, we wouldn't be so interested in it as a predictor. So we want to test how likely it is that b<sub>1</sub> in our sample came from a world where &beta;<sub>1</sub> is 0, or if we want to reject that explanation. \n",
    "\n",
    "In step 3, we now need to fit a model in it. We need to specify the equation of that model so we know what we're testing: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{Y} = b_0 + b_1X_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And then we will fit that equation with ```lm()``` as we have done many times before:"

    "Because mother's and father's education are related, there is shared variation between them - both of them explain some of the same variation in participant's education. We need to put them both in a model together in order to disentangle what amount of *unique* variation they each explain. By doing this, we see that the effect of mother's education got much smaller, after taking father's education into account - the coefficient fell from 0.315 to 0.08. This effect is so small, that it is no longer significant - the p-value is 0.407, which is above our &alpha; cutoff of 0.05. We'd interpret this to mean that a world where there is *no* unique effect of mother's education (&beta;<sub>1</sub> = 0), and b<sub>1</sub> estimate of 0.08 would be a likely outcome. We can further see this by checking the 95% confidence interval:"
