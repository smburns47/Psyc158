    "\n",
    "The first important point about data is that data are – meaning that the word “data” is plural. You might also wonder how to pronounce “data” – some people say “DAY-tah”, some say “DAH-tah.” Some people even use both interchangeably, within the same conversation! Data are the focus and currency of statistics - you can't do it without data, and qualities about the data determine the type of reliability of your analyses. In this chapter, we will introduce you to different types of data, how they are represented in R, and how to reason about when data are good quality or not. "

    "\n",
    "Data are the measurements that make up **variables**. Variables are sets of measurements that, across many values, will vary in some way. For example, human intelligence is a variable because everyone has a separate intelligence score and we would likely measure different values for different people. The values of intelligence would vary person to person. In contrast, people's species is *not* a variable, since by definition all humans are *homo sapien.* There's no variation datapoint to datapoint. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Qualitative data\n",
    "There are different types of variables. Some are **qualitative**, meaning that they describe a quality rather than a numeric quantity. For example, say we ran a survey in class that asked “What is your favorite food?” Some of the answers may be: blueberries, chocolate, tamales, pasta, and pizza. Those data are not intrinsically numerical; there's nothing to indicate quantity or numerical relations among them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In R, there are also different types of objects we can rely on to represent different data types. We can represent qualitative data like words or letters with the **character** value type. Remember at the beginning of Chapter 1 when you printed out ```\"hello world!\"```? By putting those words within a set of quotation marks, we created a character-type object. This is also known in other programming languages as a \"string\". If we forget the quotes, R will think that a word is a name of an object instead of a character value. Note that numbers can also be turned into character values - for example, when 20 is in quotation marks like this – “20” – it will be treated as a character value, even though it includes a number. R doesn’t care whether you use single quotes, ‘like this’, or double quotes, ”like that\". "

    "## 2.5 What makes good data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data are meant to be a clear and accurate representation of some value out in the world. However, in many fields such as psychology, the thing that we are measuring is not a physical feature, but instead an unobservable theoretical concept, which we usually refer to as a **construct**. For example, let’s say that we want to test how well you understand the distinction between categorical, ordinal, and interval scales of measurement (do you remember? test yourself!). The professor could give you a pop quiz that would ask you several questions about these concepts and count how many you got right. This would be one way to try and measure the construct that is your knowledge. However, constructs are difficult to measure well. There are several things that can get in the way of good measurement, meaning your recorded data don't perfectly represent what the values are in the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reliability \n",
    "\n",
    "**Reliability** refers to the consistency of our measurements. One common form of reliability, known as **test-retest reliability**, measures how well the measurements agree if the same measurement is performed twice. For example, someone might give you a cognitive test of spatial reasoning twice, once today and once tomorrow, and compare your scores on the two days. If the test is a good measurement of your true spatial reasoning ability (which shouldn't change on such a short time scale), we would hope that the scores would be very similar to one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to assess reliability comes in cases where the data include subjective judgments. For example, let’s say that a researcher wants to determine whether a treatment changes how well an autistic child interacts with other children, which is measured by having experts watch the child and rate their interactions with the other children. In this case we would like to make sure that the answers don’t depend on who is doing the rating. That is, we would like for there to be high **inter-rater reliability**. This can be assessed by having more than one rater perform the rating, and then comparing their ratings to make sure that they agree well with one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reliability is important if we want to compare one measurement to another, because the relationship between two different variables can’t be any stronger than the relationship between either of the variables and itself (i.e., its reliability). An unreliable measure will never have a strong statistical relationship with any other measure. For this reason, researchers developing a new measurement (such as a new survey) will often go to great lengths to establish and improve its reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Validity\n",
    "\n",
    "If a measured variable proves to be unreliable, there are a few reasons why. One is the **validity** of the variable. This means we want to make sure that we are actually measuring the construct that we think we are measuring. There are many different types of validity that are discussed in human subjects research; here are some common ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Face validity** - Does the measurement make sense on its face? If I were to tell you that I was going to measure a person’s blood pressure by looking at the color of their tongue, you would probably think that this was not a valid measure on its face. On the other hand, using a blood pressure cuff would have face validity. This is usually a first reality check before we dive into more complicated aspects of validity. If you read about a construct measurement that doesn't seem face valid to you (e.g., \"what your shirt color says about you!!\"), you should be immediately suspicious of it until there is good evidence of other validity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is the measurement related to other measurements in an appropriate way? This is often subdivided into two aspects. **Convergent validity** means that the measurement should be closely related to other measures that are thought to reflect the same or similar construct. Let’s say that I am interested in measuring how extroverted a person is using either a questionnaire or an interview. Convergent validity would be demonstrated if both of these different measurements are closely related to one another. On the other hand, measurements thought to reflect different constructs should be unrelated, known as **divergent validity**. If my theory of personality says that extraversion and conscientiousness are two distinct constructs, then I should also see that my measurements of extraversion are unrelated to measurements of conscientiousness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Low validity can be a reason why a measured variable is unreliable. In that case, you are probably measuring something else that varies more than expected, or you're measuring just noise. But note that even if a variable is reliable, that doesn't automatically make it valid. I could score your well-being as \"excellent\" every day that you aren't in the hospital, which would probably have high test-retest reliability. But that misses important variations in mental health, financial security, social connection, etc. that would impact your sense of wellness. In this way, hospitalization is not an entirely valid measure of well-being. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/ch3-relyvalid.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "*A figure demonstrating the distinction between reliability and validity, using shots at a bullseye. The consistency of location of shots is a metaphor for reliability, and the accuracy of the shots with respect to the center of the bullseye.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measurement error \n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason for low reliability in data is **measurement error**. Even if we are measuring a valid construct, our recorded values may be different from reality because of an imperfect measurement system. Measurement error can come from lots of places - a poorly calibrated timer, participant motion during a brain imaging session, imperfect self insight while filling out a survey, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "We generally want our measurement error to be as low as possible, so you'll need to think hard about how you can improve the quality of your measurement system (for example, using a better timer to measure reaction time). Another option to improve measurement error if your measurement system can't be perfected is to measure many times and average the values together. This is what is happening when you answer a survey with many similar questions, or do a psych study with many trials. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Outliers and missing values\n",
    "\n",
    "Reliability, validity, and measurement error are properties of an entire variable, meaning all data values recorded are affected in some way. However not every research participant is the same, so not every participant will have the same experience in your study. It is possible that most data points in your dataset are good data, but a few people misunderstand a question or or skip it for some personal reason. Humans are messy like that. In these cases, you'll have a few data points that don't represent the correct real world value. \n",
    "\n",
    "If some datapoint is very unusual compared to the rest of the dataset (e.g. someone reporting their age as \"211\" when everyone else is 18-24), that is called an **outlier**. Not all outliers are invalid data points - it's possible to get a very tall person in your sample of otherwise short people, for instance. But if a datapoint value is unusual because it is not recorded correctly, that is the kind of bad outlier than can mess up analyses. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a datapoint is missing entirely, that is a **missing value**. Some analyses can be computed with missing data included no sweat, but some others mathematically break and thus need researcher intervention. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are some actions a researcher can take to handle bad outliers and missing values while maintaining the integrity of their dataset. In chapters 4 and 5 we will discuss methods of identifying and dealing with bad data points from a larger set.  "
