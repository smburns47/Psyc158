    "*“Statistical thinking will one day be as necessary for efficient citizenship as the ability to read and write.” - H.G. Wells*\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Life is messy and complex - things like people, animals, weather, even microscopic bacteria can vary between each other in a multitude of ways, for a multitude of reasons. How do we make sense of this complexity and still describe our world in reasonably accurate ways? Statistics is the discipline that helps us with this - it is how we turn variation in the world into variation in ***data***, and how we analyze that data in order to give us answers about the essential structure or function of the world.    \n",

    "<b>Data</b>: (Plural, singular datum.) The quantities, characters, or symbols on which mathematical operations can be computed.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The foundations of statistics come primarily from mathematics, but also from computer science, psychology, and other fields of study. From this interdisciplinary crucible, statistics has emerged as not just a collection of facts or equations. Statistics is a way of *thinking*, distinct from other forms of thinking that are less likely to describe the world accurately. In particular, statistics can answer the sorts of questions where human intuition fails. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in recent years most Americans have reported that they think violent crime was worse compared to the previous year ([Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/11/20/facts-about-crime-in-the-u-s/)). However, a statistical analysis of the actual crime data shows that in fact violent crime has steadily decreased since the 1990’s. Intuition fails us because we rely upon best guesses (which psychologists refer to as *heuristics*) that can often get it wrong. In this case, humans often judge the prevalence of some event (like violent crime) using an availability heuristic – that is, how easily can we think of an example of violent crime. For this reason, our judgments of increasing crime rates may be more reflective of increasing news coverage, in spite of an actual decrease in the rate of crime. Statistical thinking provides us with the tools to more accurately understand the world and overcome the biases of human judgment.\n",

    "## 2.2 What can statistics do for us?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three major things we can do with statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Describe**: The world is complex and we often need to describe it in a simplified way that we can understand.\n",
    "- **Decide**: We often need to make decisions based on data, usually in the face of uncertainty.\n",
    "- **Predict**: We often wish to make predictions about new situations based on our knowledge of previous situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at an example of each of these use cases in action. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Describe\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we know what’s healthy to eat? There are many different sources of guidance; government dietary guidelines, diet books, and bloggers, just to name a few. Let’s focus in on a specific question: Is saturated fat in our diet a bad thing?\n",
    "\n",
    "One way that we might answer this question is common sense. If we eat fat, then it’s going to turn straight into fat in our bodies, right? And we have all seen photos of arteries clogged with fat, so eating fat is going to clog our arteries, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way that we might answer this question is to look at actual data on the subject. One large-scale study, called the PURE study, examined diets and health outcomes (including death) in more than 135,000 people from 18 different countries. In one of the analyses of this dataset (published in The Lancet in 2017; [Dehghan et al. (2017)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28864332/)), the PURE investigators reported how intake of various classes of macronutrients (including saturated fats and carbohydrates) was related to the likelihood of dying during the time that people were followed. The plot below displays some of the data from the study (extracted from the paper), showing the relationship between the intake of both saturated fats and carbohydrates and the risk of dying from any cause.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/ch2-satfats.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "*A plot of data from the PURE study, showing the relationship between death from any cause and the relative intake of saturated fats and carbohydrates.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry if this plot is hard to read at this time - you'll get there! For now, notice the ten points where the lines run through. To obtain the numbers represented by these points, the researchers split the group of 135,335 study participants (which we call the ***sample***) into 5 groups based on how much they ate each type of nutrient (carbohydrates and saturated fats). The first group contains the 20% of people with the lowest intake, and the 5th group contains the 20% with the highest intake. The researchers then computed how often people in each of those groups died during the time the study was conducted. The figure expresses this in terms of the relative risk of dying in comparison to the lowest group: If this number is greater than one, it means that people in the group are more likely to die than are people in the lowest group, whereas if it’s less than one, it means that people in the group are less likely to die. The figure is pretty clear: People who ate more saturated fat were less likely to die during the study. The opposite is seen for carbohydrates; the more carbs a person ate, the more likely they were to die during the study. \n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows how we can use statistics to describe a complex dataset in terms of a much simpler set of numbers. It would be very hard to tell whether carbs or saturdated fat were worse for you by looking at the whole dataset at once (135,335 points of data!). But by using statistics, we can *aggregate* and *compare* sets of information to make the takeaway lesson easier to see.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decide\n",
    "\n",
    "The numbers in this figure seem to show that deaths decrease with saturated fat and increase with carbohydrate intake. But we also know that there is a lot of uncertainty in these data; there are some people who died early even though they ate a low-carb diet, and some people who ate a ton of carbs but lived to a ripe old age. Given this variability, we want to decide whether the patterns that we see in the data are large enough that we wouldn’t expect them to occur randomly if there was not truly a connection between diet and longevity. Statistics provide us with the tools to make these kinds of decisions, and often people from the outside view this as the main purpose of statistics. But as we will see throughout the course, this need for black-and-white decisions based on fuzzy evidence has often led researchers astray. Thus, there are also methods within statistics to tell us how confident we can be with our conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Predict\n",
    "\n",
    "These data help us explain how diet is related to longevity for people in the PURE study, but we might also want to make predictions about other people *not* included in the dataset, or outcomes that haven't happened yet. For example, a life insurance company might want to use data about a particular person’s intake of fat and carbohydrate to predict how long they are likely to live. An important aspect of prediction is that it requires us to generalize from the data we already have to some other situation, often in the future; if our conclusions were limited to the specific people in the study at a particular time, then the study would not be very useful. In general, researchers must assume that their particular sample is representative of a larger population, which requires that they obtain the sample in a way that provides an unbiased picture of the population. If, say, the PURE study had recruited all of its participants from religious sects that practice vegetarianism, then we probably wouldn’t want to generalize the results to people who follow different dietary standards. But if this dataset included a good number of people that follow a diversity of diets, these results can probably help us make predictions about other people as well."

    "## 2.3 The big ideas of statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Since statistics is a way of thinking, there are some basic ideas that are important to remember for doing statistics well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning from data\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, statistics is the pursuit of knowledge via data. In any situation, we start with a set of ideas or hypotheses about what might be the case. In the PURE study, the researchers may have started out with the expectation that eating more fat would lead to higher death rates, given the prevailing negative dogma about saturated fats. But this hypothesis is not where the researchers stopped - they collected data to test it. In the end, the patterns in the data revealed a different reality. Data thus can help us solidify our beliefs, update them, or even inspire new ideas. It is the central currency of doing a science like psychology. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Operationalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of the statement \"dogs are good pets.\" On the surface, it seems like a pretty simple, straight-forward claim. But now think of what it would take to support this statement with evidence. What counts in the category \"dogs?\" What actions or qualities are relavent to being evaluated as a good pet? And what even does \"good\" mean? I.e., if they make you smile sometimes, is that good? Are they still good pets if every other animal makes you smile all the time? \n",
    "\n",
    "Assigning concrete meaning to abstract or vague concepts like this is called **operationalization,** and is required for statistics to work. In order to do any computations on data, you need to be able to break a hypothesis down in smaller conceptual units and define what those mean in easy-to-understand ways. This enables you to 1) define what set of data to use (e.g., what counts as a \"dog\" and what doggy actions are relevant to you); 2) choose what kind of analysis to do on the data; and 3) evaluate how important your analysis is for understanding the topic as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aggregation\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to think of statistics is as “the science of throwing away data”. In the example of the PURE study above, we took more than 100,000 numbers and condensed them into ten. It is this kind of aggregation that is one of the most important concepts in statistics. When it was first advanced, this was revolutionary: If we throw out all of the details about every one of the participants, then how can we be sure that we aren’t missing something important? As we will see, statistics provides us ways to characterize the aggregates of data in a way that still preserves information about the total. However, it’s also important to keep in mind that aggregation can go too far, and later we will encounter cases where a summary can provide a very misleading picture of the data being summarized.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "The world is an uncertain place. We now know that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer, but this causation is probabilistic: A 68-year-old man who smoked two packs a day for the past 50 years and continues to smoke has a 15% (1 out of 7) risk of getting lung cancer, which is much higher than the chance of lung cancer in a nonsmoker. However, it also means that there will be many people who smoke their entire lives and never get lung cancer. Furthermore, it's possible that even when all measurable variables are the same, e.g., this man has a genetically identical twin brother who smokes the exact same amount and has the exact same lifestyle, one of them might get cancer while the other does not. Statistics provides us with the tools to characterize uncertainty, to make decisions under uncertainty, and to make predictions whose uncertainty we can quantify.\n",
    "\n",
    "One often sees journalists write that scientific researchers have “proven” some hypothesis. But statistical analysis can never “prove” a hypothesis, in the sense of demonstrating that it must be true (as one would in a logical or mathematical proof). Statistics can provide us with evidence, but it’s always tentative and subject to the uncertainty that is always present in the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sampling from a population\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of aggregation implies that we can make useful insights by collapsing across data – but how much data do we need? The idea of sampling says that we can summarize an entire population based on just a small number of samples from the population, as long as those samples are obtained in the right way. For example, the PURE study enrolled a sample of about 135,000 people, but its goal was to provide insights about the billions of humans who make up the population from which those people were sampled. As we already discussed above, the way that the study sample is obtained is critical, as it determines how broadly we can generalize the results. Another fundamental insight about sampling is that while larger samples are always better (in terms of their ability to accurately represent the entire population), there are diminishing returns as the sample gets larger.

    "## 2.4 Problem-solving & computational thinking\n",
    "\n",
    "When you practice the statistical way of thinking, you also exercise your problem-solving brain muscles. Statistics requires you to be able to take a research question, break it down into logical steps, and decide how to do each of those steps with computation and numbers. Doing this is also called \"computational thinking.\" While statistics isn't unique in requiring this skill, it goes a long way towards understanding how to do research analysis start to finish, and understanding how to write the code that will execute all that for you!\n",
    "\n",
    "This may sound straightforward at first, but practicing it even with simple processes at first will give you the skills to tackle more complex problems. For example, take the act of making ice cubes. It's sound easy, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Put a tray of water in the freezer\n",
    "\n",
    "It sounds very simple to humans, but imagine you're talking to an alien that doesn't know what any of those things are. You need to define all the steps for them. What are a freezer and tray? How does water get into the tray to start? Computers are like this too, and you need to be very explicit with them. "

    "## 2.5 Coding control flow\n",
    "\n",
    "This brings us to another concept in R programming that we should cover before we get too much further into learning statistics - control flow. This refers to telling a programming language, like R, in what order you want it to evaluate code commands in. Usually in R we don't actually need to explicit use control flow like this, because many functions we use will do it for us. However, breaking down analysis problems often involves thinking about the control flow of your analysis code, so we want you to be familiar with this way of doing things.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we haven't written much more than a few lines of code at a time, but what happens when you write code that are many lines long? How is it all executed? By default, R reads your code from the top of a file to the bottom. Each line of code happens one at a time, in order. But sometimes you want R to do things multiple times, or you want it to do different things depending on some condition. For example, say you were writing a program that would cook chicken:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Add heat to pan\n",
    "2) Add chicken breast\n",
    "3) Check chicken doneness once a minute\n",
    "4) Once chicken is done, turn off heat\n",
    "5) If bland, add salt to chicken\n",
    "\n",
    "To do the above with code, you need to *control* what steps R executes, and when to execute them. These two concepts **conditional statements** and **loops**, and by including some specific syntax, you can tell R when want code to be treated in a special way like this.  "

For instance, if the ```while``` loop above didn't include the command to increment the value of ```hour``` by 1, the logical statement would never become false and the code would run forever. You'd never stop studying! Infinite while loops are a common cause of program hangs and crashes.\n",
