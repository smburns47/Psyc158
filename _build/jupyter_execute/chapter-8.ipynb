    "# Chapter 8 - Where Data Come From\n",
    "\n",
    "We can learn a lot by examining distributions and summaries of a dataset. We can describe the current state of some situation for a clearer picture about reality around us. But in data analysis, our interest usually goes beyond these data alone. We are generally looking at data because we trying to find insights into the broader population it came from. What will a new data point look like? What will the future look like, so we are prepared for it? This is the goal of using statistics for prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "We may also want to find out *why* our data are they way they are; to infer the ways in which the world works. What made the data come out this way? As we discussed earlier, statistics alone can't determine cause and effect, but it can give us important clues about the mechanisms of the human mind and society. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is when we now move from **descriptive statistics** (describing features of a dataset) to **inferential statistics** (using that dataset to understand the population it came from). We are going to switch from asking questions like \"what do the data look like,\" to trying to understand what could have produced the specific pattern of variation we see in our data. In this chapter, let's explore various reasons why a dataset may end up looking the way it does, given a particular population. This will help us build intuitions for later when we try to infer the population when all we have is a sample of data. "

    "## 8.1 Samples vs. populations\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's define what we mean by the word **population** above. The population of some data is the distribution of all possible values those data could take. In psychology, that often means some quality about people - all people who exist and who will ever exist. We have been using a dataset of student demographics like thumb length, but that dataset is not the only thumb values out there. Many more people have thumbs and heights than are included in our dataset. In contrast, a **sample** is a subset of the population. Our dataset is a sample, because it includes some but not all of the people who have thumbs. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/ch8-thumbpop.png\" width=\"700\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, people are not the only population one might be interested in. If you're in astronomy, you could be interested in the population of all stars in the universe. If you're a biologist, maybe you're interested in all bacteria of a certain strain. Populations don't have to be physical entities, either; as an engineer building a bridge, you may be concerned with the population of all possible force vectors that your bridge could experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you are studying people, your population might not consist of *all* people. Maybe we don't care about understanding the typical thumb length of all people, but rather college students specifically. Or perhaps we're only concerned with students in our own class - in that case our sample *is* our population of interest, and we don't have to do any inferential statistics at all! \n",
    "\n",
    "Usually though, we are interested in more general populations in the world. In those cases, it is impractical or even impossible to measure every datapoint from the population. A sample is all we have. Thus, it is very important to have a good idea of what population we are trying to understand. Only then can we use our sample for inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, what makes a *good* sample? If we want to use a sample to make inferences about a population, we want that sample to be **representative** of that population. In other words, the sample distribution should closely resemble the population distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Political polling is a good example of why it's important to have representative samples. Sometimes, polls can be incredibly accurate at predicting the outcomes of elections. The best known example comes from the 2008 and 2012 US Presidential elections, when the pollster Nate Silver correctly predicted electoral outcomes for 49/50 states in 2008 and for all 50 states in 2012. Silver did this by combining data from 21 different polls, each of which included data from about 1000 likely voters. If we consider the population of interest during an election to be all the votes of people who cast a vote, then in this case the intentions of that 1000-person sample very closely matched the overall voting behavior of the entire electorate. Yet, the 2016 US Presidential election was noteworthy for how *poorly* polls predicted the outcome (Clinton was strongly favored to win by many polling samples, but the electorate behaved differently). This is because the people who came out to vote for Donald Trump were not well represented in the poll samples. Bad predictions were made because of bad sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you think our ```studentdata``` dataset is a good representation of what that broader population of thumb lengths is like? What about the population of thumb lengths from college students specifically? What if our sample came only from Scripps, given what we've seen about sex and thumb length variance? Before you do research and publish your results, make sure you are able to collect a sample that speaks to the population you are interested in."

    "## 8.2 The sampling process\n",
    "\n",
    "How do data make it from the population to being in a sample? The selection of certain data points over others is called the **sampling process**, and will determine how representative the sample is. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many samples are based on practicality, where the sample is comprised of datapoints that were the easiest to obtain. This is called **convenience sampling**. The samples are chosen in a way that is convenient to the researcher. In real life, most studies are convenience samples of one form or another. If you do a thesis on human cognition but collect data from other students, this is inherently a convenience sample because it is much easier for you to access other students than people from the opposite side of the world. \n",
    "\n",
    "Convenience sampling sometimes does a good job of creating a representative sample, but can instead create a **biased sample** if there's some reason for why the sample is easier to collect that also affects the variables being studied. E.g., can you think of any way college students might differ from other people? Would those differences matter for understanding cognition processes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, statisticians have figured out that the best way to pick a sample that most closely resembles the shape, center, and variability of the target population is to draw a **random sample**. Random in this case means every member of the population has an equal chance of getting picked for the sample. This is usually impractical, though. For a psychologist, it's not as easy to contact, recruit, or even know about some people in the population compared to others (indeed, the data in psychology results are often based on an over-representation of US psychology students, since universities require their psych majors to participate in studies!). For an ecologist, it is much easier to access animals that live in one site nearby, versus the same species that lives in a remote canyon. You can probably think of examples in other fields of study that make it hard to sample every member of the population at equal likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, it is important to know the difference between **sampling with replacement** and **sampling without replacement.** With replacement means that, after picking a data point out of the entire population for inclusion in the sample, you record its value and then put it back \"into the bag\" of the population, so that it has a chance of being selected again. Without replacement is the opposite - once a data point is recorded, it can't be selected again. In real world data collection, you almost always use sampling without replacement because you want to collect as much unique information in your data as possible. I.e., once someone has participated in your study, you don't let them participate again. However, for some theoretical or simulating procedures that we will do later in this chapter, sampling with replacement is an underlying assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, even though random sampling is the most representative sampling process, that doesn't always mean the sample you end up with will look exactly like the population, or even other samples. For example, the picture below shows a population of thumb lengths from which several N=100 random samples were drawn:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/ch8-thumbsamples.png\" width=\"900\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite all coming from the same population, and all being generated with the same random sampling process, these samples are somewhat different from each other. Some are more skewed or peaked than others, and they all have different means which are themselves different from the population mean. If random sampling is representative, why is it not making samples that are simply mini versions of the population distribution? "

    "## 8.3 Probability \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this, we need to take a detour into learning about **probability**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a much easier population to understand - rolls on a six-sided die. There are only six options. The set of these options is known as the **sample space** in probability theory, and would be written like {1,2,3,4,5,6}. For a fair die, all of these options have the same chance of occurring. Because of this, the distribution of the population die rolls looks like a uniform distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/ch8-diepop.png\"  width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's draw a very small sample from this population - just one die roll. This is known as an **elementary event** in probability theory, and may be writted as X = E (where X is a die roll variable that takes on the value of some event E for one specific roll). Obviously with a sample like this, we can't get a sample distribution that looks like above. We can only get one value (e.g., X = 2). If we draw another one-roll event, this value might be different (e.g., X = 4). \n",
    "\n",
    "With one roll, we can't get a sample that looks like the population. We also can't predict what the exact value of any one roll will be. However, if we were to roll the die many times, the *proportion* of times the die came up with a specific value would be about 1/6, since there are six possible options in the sample space. \n",
    "\n",
    "The proportion of times an elementary event will equal the value of one outcome in the sample space is the **probability** of that outcome. While you can't know for sure if the next roll of the die will equal 6, the *probability* that it does is 1/6 (~0.167). Written mathematically:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(X = 6) = 0.167$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If you guessed that the next roll of the die would be 6, you will be right about 16.7% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Incidentally, take a look again at the die roll population distribution above, and notice the density value of each roll option. It equals 0.167, the same as the probability of each option. Because of this, population distributions are also known as **probability distributions**. The proportion of the population that equals a particular value is the probability of getting that value if we randomly drew one event from the population. Since probabilities are proportions of data, there are some basic axioms about what probability an event can have:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Probability cannot be negative**: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(X = E_i) => 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **The total probability of all outcomes in the sample space is 1**; that is, if we take the probability of each E<sub>i</sub> and add them up, they must sum to 1. We can express this using the summation symbol:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{i=1}^{N} P(X = E_i) = P(X = E_1) + P(X = E_2) + P(X = E_3) + ... + P(X = E_N) = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is interpreted as saying “Take all of the N elementary events, which we have labeled from 1 to N, and add up their probabilities. These must sum to one.” Another way of saying this, which will come in handy later in the course, is that the probability of *NOT* E<sub>i</sub> is 1-P(X = E<sub>i</sub>).\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **The probability of any individual event cannot be greater than one**: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(X = E_i) <= 1$$\n",
    "\n",

For us, now that you appreciate the shapes of probability distributions and how to simulate events, you won't have to just memorize these equations - you'll have a deeper sense for why they are the way they are. \n",
