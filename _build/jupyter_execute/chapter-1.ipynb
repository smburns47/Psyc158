    "# Chapter 1 - Introduction to Statistical Thinking  \n",
    "\n",
    "*“Statistical thinking will one day be as necessary for efficient citizenship as the ability to read and write.” - H.G. Wells*\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Starting out \n",
    "\n",
    "Life is messy and complex - things like people, animals, weather, even microscopic bacteria can vary between each other in a multitude of ways, for a multitude of reasons. How do we make sense of this complexity and still describe our world in reasonably accurate ways? Statistics is the discipline that helps us with this. It is how we turn variation in the world into variation in data, and how we analyze that data in order to give us answers about the essential structure or function of the world.    \n",
    "\n",
    "The foundations of statistics come primarily from mathematics, but also from computer science, psychology, and other fields of study. From this interdisciplinary crucible, statistics has emerged as not just a collection of facts or equations. Statistics is a way of *thinking*, distinct from other approaches to knowledge. In particular, statistics can answer the sorts of questions where human intuition fails. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in recent years political ads have emphasized violent crime as a problem in the US, and most Americans have reported that they see violent crime as a serious societal issue ([Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/10/31/violent-crime-is-a-key-midterm-voting-issue-but-what-does-the-data-say)). However, a statistical analysis of the actual crime data shows that in fact violent crime has steeply decreased since the 1990’s. Intuition fails us because we rely upon best guesses (which psychologists refer to as *heuristics*) that can often get it wrong. In this case, humans often judge the prevalence of some event (like violent crime) using an availability heuristic – that is, how easily can we think of an example of violent crime. For this reason, our judgments of crime rates may be more reflective of increasing news coverage and political discourse, in spite of an actual decrease in the rate of crime. Statistical thinking provides us with the tools to more accurately understand the world and overcome the biases of human judgment.\n",

    "*Graph from the Pew Research Center showing the number of violent victimizations per 1,000 Americans age 12 and older in each year between 1993-2021, and that number broken down into different categories of violent crime (simple assault, aggravated assault, robbery, and rape/sexual assult). In all categories, the number of incidents has declined since 1993.*\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to appreciate how statistical thinking is different from our default intuitions, and to practice using it before doing any math or touching any data. In this chapter, we will cover the types of questions that statistics can answer for us, what is needed from us to answer those questions, and how to start out using those core skills."

    "## 1.2 What can statistics do for us?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three major things we can do with statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Describe**: The world is complex and we often need to describe it in a simplified way that we can understand.\n",
    "- **Predict**: We often wish to make predictions about new situations based on our knowledge of previous situations.\n",
    "- **Infer**: Beyond knowing what is likely to happen, we also try to understand *why* it happens. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at an example of each of these use cases in action. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Describe\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we know what’s healthy to eat? There are many different sources of guidance; government dietary guidelines, diet books, and bloggers, just to name a few. Let’s focus in on a specific question: Is saturated fat in our diet a bad thing?\n",
    "\n",
    "One way that we might answer this question is common sense. If we eat fat, then it’s going to turn straight into fat in our bodies, right? And we have all seen photos of arteries clogged with fat, so eating fat is going to clog our arteries, right? Could be, or this could be an availability heuristic again fed by media sources.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way that we might answer this question is to look at actual data on the subject. One large-scale study, called the PURE study, examined diets and health outcomes (including death) in more than 135,000 people from 18 different countries. In one of the analyses of this dataset (published in The Lancet in 2017; [Dehghan et al. (2017)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28864332/)), the PURE investigators reported how intake of various classes of macronutrients (including saturated fats and carbohydrates) was related to the likelihood of dying during the time that people were followed. The plot below displays some of the data from the study (extracted from the paper), showing the relationship between the intake of both saturated fats and carbohydrates and the risk of dying from any cause.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/ch2-satfats.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "*A plot of data from the PURE study describing death rates among people based on the amount of saturated fats and carbohydrates they intake. The death rate seems to increase for larger amounts of carbohydrates, and slightly decrease for larger amounts of saturdated fats.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry if this plot is hard to read at this time - you'll get there! For now, notice the ten points where the lines run through. To obtain the numbers represented by these points, the researchers split the group of 135,335 study participants (which we call the **sample**) into 5 groups based on how much they ate each type of nutrient (carbohydrates and saturated fats). The first group contains the 20% of people with the lowest intake, and the 5th group contains the 20% with the highest intake. The researchers then computed how often people in each of those groups died during the time the study was conducted. The figure expresses this on the Y-axis in terms of the relative risk of dying in comparison to the lowest group: If this number is greater than one, it means that people in the group are more likely to die than are people in the lowest group, whereas if it’s less than one, it means that people in the group are less likely to die. According to this figure, people who ate more saturated fat had lower relative risk of death during the study. The opposite is seen for carbohydrates; the more carbs a person ate, the higher the relative risk of death during the study. \n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows how we can use statistics to describe a complex dataset with much simpler numbers. It would be very hard to tell the relative risk of death for a particular carbohydrate intake level by looking at the whole dataset at once (135,335 points of data!). By using statistics, we can *aggregate* and *compare* sets of information to make the takeaway information easier to see. Specifically, the family of statistical tools that help with this kind of insight is called **descriptive statistics**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Predict\n",
    "\n",
    "These data help us see what relative death risk one can expect based on one's intake level of saturated fats or carbs. But these numbers describe the people in the PURE study specifically. We might also want to make predictions about other people *not* included in the dataset, or outcomes that haven't happened yet. For example, a life insurance company might want to guess how long someone is likely to live in order to set their premium amount. They base that prediction on some combination of information about the person, and this can include information about their intake of fat and carbohydrates. The type of statistics that help us make predictions about new data are known as **predictive models**. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we are to make predictions about new people, it's important that our predictions are good. You wouldn't want to trust a model that did no better than if you were to randomly guess a group's relative risk of death. You also wouldn't want to use a model that was based only on a particular group of people, like vegetarians, as that might not apply to people with other sorts of diets. In addition to building predictive models, statistics also gives us the tools to evaluate these models' predictive accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Infer\n",
    "\n",
    "The numbers in this figure seem to show that some groups of people have different relative risks of death. Why? If your answer included the work \"*because*\", then you just made an inference - a guess about the process that generated these death risk data. In this case, it looks like consumption of fat and carbohydrates at least partially explains why someone has a lower or higher risk of death. Given this information, we might decide to make changes in our own lives in order to influence our own risk of death.  \n",
    "\n",
    "But we also know that there is a lot of uncertainty in these data; there are some people who died early even though they ate a low-carb diet, and some people who ate a ton of carbs but lived to a ripe old age. Given this variability, we want to decide whether the patterns that we see in the data are large enough that we wouldn’t expect them to occur randomly if there was not truly a connection between diet and longevity. In other words, we want to be confident that the pattern we are seeing is real, and that carbohydrates are very likely the reason for this increased risk in death. \n",
    "\n",
    "Often people from the outside view these kinds of insights as absolute answers - we are *proving* a relationship between diet and death risk. But as we will see throughout the course, this need for black-and-white decisions based on fuzzy evidence has often led researchers astray. Thus, there are also methods within statistics to tell us how confident we can be with our conclusions, known as **inferential statistics**. "

    "## 1.3 The big ideas of statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Since statistics is a way of thinking, there are some basic principles that are important to remember for doing statistics well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning from data\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, statistics is the pursuit of knowledge via data. In any situation, we start with a set of ideas or hypotheses about what might be the case. In the PURE study, the researchers may have started out with the expectation that eating more fat would lead to higher death rates, given the prevailing negative dogma about saturated fats. Maybe they also had their own experience dealing with health problems while on a high-fat diet. But this hypothesis is not where the researchers stopped - they collected many data points to test it. In the end, the patterns in the data revealed a different reality. Data thus can help us solidify our beliefs, update them, or even inspire new ideas. It is the central currency of doing a science like psychology. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Aggregation\n",
    "\n",
    "Although you do statistics using data, another way to think of the process is how best to *throw away* data. In the example of the PURE study above, we took more than 100,000 numbers and condensed them into ten. It is this kind of aggregation that is one of the most important concepts in statistics. When it was first advanced, this was revolutionary: If we throw out all of the details about every one of the participants, then how can we be sure that we aren’t missing something important? As we will see, statistics provides us ways to characterize the aggregates of data in a way that still preserves information about the total - it finds patterns among noise. However, it’s also important to keep in mind that aggregation can go too far, and later we will encounter cases where a summary can provide a very misleading picture of the data being summarized.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sampling from a population\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of aggregation implies that we can make useful insights by collapsing across data. But how much data do we need, and from who? The idea of sampling says that we can reliably summarize an entire **population** based on a small number of data points from the population, as long as those data are obtained in the right way. For example, the PURE study enrolled a sample of about 135,000 people, but its goal was to provide insights about the billions of humans who make up the population from which those people were sampled. The way that the study sample is obtained is critical - it determines how broadly we can generalize our results. Another fundamental insight about sampling we will learn about is that while larger samples are always better (in terms of their ability to accurately represent the entire population), there are diminishing returns as the sample gets larger. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Operationalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of the statement \"dogs are good pets.\" On the surface, it seems like a pretty simple, straight-forward claim. But now think of what it would take to support this statement with evidence. What counts in the category \"dogs?\" What actions or qualities are relavent to being evaluated as a good pet? And what even does \"good\" mean?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Assigning concrete meaning to abstract or vague concepts like this is called **operationalization,** and is required for statistics to give you usable answers. In order to do any analysis, you need to be able to break a hypothesis down into smaller conceptual units and define what those mean in easy-to-understand ways. This enables you to 1) define what set of data to use (e.g., what counts as a \"dog\" and what doggy actions are relevant to you); 2) choose what kind of analysis to do on the data; and 3) evaluate how much your analysis contributes to understanding broader topics of all pet ownership.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "The world is an uncertain place. We now know that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer, but this relationship is probabilistic. Consider a 68-year-old man who smoked two packs a day for the past 50 years and continues to smoke. He has a 15% (1 out of 7) risk of getting lung cancer, which is much higher than the chance of lung cancer in a nonsmoker. However, it also means that there will be many people like him who smoke their entire lives and never get lung cancer. Furthermore, it's possible that even when all measurable variables are the same, e.g., this man has a genetically identical twin brother who smokes the exact same amount and has the exact same lifestyle, one of them might get cancer while the other does not. This is a case of uncertainty: we can never be *sure* that something will happen, only various levels of confident. Statistics provides us with the tools to characterize this uncertainty and to make decisions under uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "One often sees journalists write that scientific researchers have “proven” some hypothesis. But statistical analysis can never “prove” a hypothesis, in the sense of demonstrating that it must be true (as one would in a logical or mathematical proof). Statistics can provide us with evidence, but it’s always tentative and subject to the uncertainty that is always present in the real world."

    "## 1.4 How to do statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "The principles of statistical thinking will get you far as a consumer of stastical results when reading the news, research articles, etc. They are also the foundation you need to be able to produce your own statistical insights. But you will also need the mathematical tools to formalize those insights. This moves us from the domain of learning *about* statistics to learning to *do* statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most people have learned something about doing statistics before they get to college. Some of you have even taken whole courses in statistics before this one. If you have, you have probably heard about some or all of these things: mean, variance, standard deviation, t-test, p, F, ANOVA, regression, chi-square, normal distribution, z score, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "With such a long list, it’s no surprise that many students see statistics as a daunting subject to learn (especially if you're not very keen on math). This is completely normal! Even professional statisticians find it hard sometimes. They are always learning new things, and deepening their understanding. But don't get discouraged - if it feels hard, that just means you are making progress and pushing the boundaries of what you know. It does not mean that you aren’t capable of it. There is no such thing as a \"math person\", only people who have not yet found the math approach that clicks with them. In this course, we want to get you started along the pathway to understanding. At the end of the course you will understand more than you do now, and hopefully that will be useful to you. To do so, this course is structured around three pedagogical principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Developing deep understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the math classes you have taken before focused on solving problems and remembering equations. Because of how big the field of statistics can be, this course will work a bit differently. Instead of remembering a laundry list of disparate tools, we will focus more on understanding the deeper concepts that motivate them, and practicing statistical thinking. Understanding over memorizing, reasoning over calculating. There will still be some math to do of course, and some equations do need to be simply remembered to be helpful. But all these things are a lot more interconnected than traditionally taught, so we will focus on those connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practicing and making mistakes\n",
    "\n",
    "You can't really learn how to ride a bike just by reading about it or listening to a lecture. That can make you aware of the principles of gyroscopic progression, but you ultimately need to put yourself in the bike seat to teach your body how to balance and move. A similar principle applies to learning statistics in a way that will actually be useful to you, rather than something that vanishes from your mind as soon as you walk out of the final. You will not succeed in this class if you only read the text in these pages. You also need to practice using stats and making statistical decisions, over and over. For this reason this and the following chapters you read will include interspersed windows for you to interactively try out new ideas you learn, as you learn them. In class we will also do collaborative problem-solving, and each week you will receive a problem set to complete. This does mean there is a lot of work to do in this class. But because of the importance of good statistical training in doing science well, I promise this hard work will pay off. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other classes you have taken in the past may have given you the expectation that the teacher will teach the student the right steps to follow for solving problems, and then the student's job is to remember the steps. This type of approach is not very helpful for learning statistics, and it's not going to help you learn coding. The best way to practice statistics is to try things and see what happens. Try something out, tweak it, see what changed, or think about why it didn’t work! Trial and error can be frustrating if we are not used to learning this way, and it may seem inefficient. But trial and error is a great way to learn because we learn from wrong answers as well as right ones. In this course we might sometimes ask you to do something wrong just to see what happens!\n",
    "\n",
    "By embracing the process of trial and error in your education, your progress will not always go in a straight line. It will be more like experimenting and exploring, making discoveries as you go. The benefit of exploring is that you will get a more thorough sense of statistics!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning through coding\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics has also been traditionally taught through a combination of hand-solved equations, and point and click software. This worked well enough for simple statistical questions about small amounts of data, but the 21st century no longer works that way. Instead, doing data analysis by writing computer code has become much more common. There are three big reasons for this: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Large data - Analyses that would have taken *months* in the 1950’s being calculated by hand can now be completed in a few seconds on a standard laptop computer using computer code. This change unleashes the ability to manage much larger amounts of data, and to ask questions in new and powerful ways.\n",
    "- Reproducibility - The [replication crisis in psychology](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/replication-crisis) over the last decade found that many prior research results could not be replicated. In some cases, even repeat analyses on the *same data* could not get the same originally published result. This is partially because, when statistics are done with point-and-click software, you can't verify whether someone clicked the right button. There's no ability to \"show your work.\" In contrast, doing statistics with code enables you to save all the code and share it, so anyone can verify what exactly you did and where any errors are, if any. \n",
    "- Practical skill - Increasingly, the world is a [data-driven place](https://www.forbes.com/sites/googlecloud/2020/05/20/how-the-world-became-data-driven-and-whats-next/?sh=61586b2557fc). Therefore, more and more employers value employees who know how to work with data and the computers that hold them. Even if you decide not to have a career in psychology or anything that uses statistics (though, as we said earlier, statistical thinking is all around us!), coding will be a valuable skill on your resume. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, in this course we will introduce you to some computer coding at the same time as you learn statistics. While this may seem daunting at this point in the course (learning two whole topics at once?!), research has shown that students actually learn statistics better by doing it through coding. It lets you get closer to the data for understanding it, allows you the autonomy to try out different things, and teaches you how to think through statistical problems logically. Therefor most of the coding we will learn in this course will be learned a couple steps at a time, along with the statistical lesson it can help you implement. "

    "\n",
    "Let's get started with learning some coding right now! The specific coding language we will use in this course is simply called \"R.\" It is a very popular tool for doing statistics among data analysts in many fields, and is a relatively easy coding language for first-time users to pick up. In this final section of the chapter, we'll teach you the basic fundamentals of R, which actually are fundamental concepts for many computer coding languages.

In R, we use a '#' symbol at the beginning of the line to denote a comment. Any line that starts with a '#' will be ignored by R.

    "You probably got a returned message that said \"Error...\" Congratulations, you just caused your first computer bug! Get comfortable with this, because you will see a *lot* of errors in your time coding, throughout this class and beyond. Everyone, even the most experienced coders, will have errors in their code at first. When this happens to you, consider it the \"first draft\" of your code that you then refine until your code does what you want. No one writes a perfect essay on their first shot, and likewise no one writes perfect code the first time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figuring out why your code had an error is a big part of programming. Usually when an error occurs, a message will appear telling you what it is. Unfortunately, while R is considered a relatively user-friendly coding language to write, it's error messages are not very easy to understand.  \n",

So when it tried to run ```print(\"hello\"``` as code, the computer doesn't know what that means - it expects functions to have both open and close parentheses. In this case, because the error says \"unexpected end of input,\" it didn't know what you were telling it to do because it didn't see the character at the end of the line that it would expect if you were asking it to execute a function. On the next line, the location of the ^ symbol tells you exactly where in the code this error happened - after the line without the close parens. \n",

To solve it, try asking your peers to review your code, or copy and pasting the error message into Google.

You'll also get better at identifying and fixing your bugs as you get used to what errors you're likely to make.\n",
