    "# Chapter 20 - Traditional Statistical Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course you have spent a long time learning about how to make predictions and do inference with the general linear model. This actually makes you rather unique in terms of how you're getting started with statistics. Most students instead learn an assortment of different statistical procedures like the t-test, ANOVA, chi-square, etc. as their introduction to data analysis. Indeed many practicing researchers also use these tools exclusively.\n",
    "\n",
    "So why learn the GLM at all if not everyone uses it? There are two pedagogical reasons for why this course emphasized this method instead of the traditional content:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Traditional tools require learning how to do hypothesis testing first** - Traditional methods fundamentally depend on Null Hypothesis Significance Testing. They start with defining a null hypothesis and cannot be interpreted without computing a t/F score and finding a p-value. This means to learn how to use these tools, students first have to learn about sampling distributions and significance testing. This is a rather abstract thing to learn first in one's statistics journey and impedes understanding for many people. This leads them to using intellectual short cuts like \"only care about p < 0.05\" despite the dangers of overrelying on that number. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Traditional tools are more variable, harder to remember** - When first starting out, the list of all the common statistical tools is often daunting. They are calculated all different ways, with different names, applied to different situations, and it's hard to remember what goes where. In contrast, the GLM is ultimatly one tool: $Y_i = b_0 + b_1X_i + e_i$. How many predictors you add to the equation and how you interpret the coefficients varies depending on your use situation, but just knowing about this one equation gets you 80% of the way there. This makes it a better starting point to build conceptual understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the advantages of the GLM however, many people still use the traditional tools. Thus, it is good for you to be able to identify them and understand how they map onto what you have learned with the GLM. Ultimately, the GLM and these tools will give you the same answer and you can choose which you prefer in your own research. Knowing both will enable you to read and understand research reports no matter what method the authors used. You may even find that most of these tools build on concepts you've already learned. They're just a different way of showing that information. "

Both of these numbers are the same (2.038), indicating that both methods are finding the difference in means between the \"both-training\" condition and the \"no-training\" condition. However, the p-values for these lines are different.\n",

It calculates the standard error of each coefficient at once, in the context of the other predictors. This means it's essentially already correcting for the fact that there are other coefficients to test. Further, it is only doing this correction for 3 comparisons with the reference group (\"both-training\" against the other three). \n",

With more comparisons, that means you have to correct the p-value by more in order to keep the family-wise error rate at $\\alpha = 0.05$. With more correction, it is harder to find any one comparison as significant. This is why the comparison between \"both-training\" and \"track-training\" is significant in the GLM (effect of \"track-training\", p = 0.0133) but not significant in the pairwise table of the ANOVA results (p = 0.0614). However, this is also why the pairwise table has comparisons for conditions like \"weight-training\" and \"track-training\", while the GLM doesn't. To get that result with a GLM approach, one of those conditions would need to be treated as the reference group. \n",

    "Of the traditional tools we've covered so far in this chapter, you can probably detect a general trend. So far we've looked at a fairly simple experimental design: each person falls into only one of several groups, and we want to know whether these groups have different means on some outcome variable. This assumes that there is only one variable that matters for differences in the outcome value - which of these groups someone is in.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in the multiple regression version of the GLM framework, we learned that multiple different predictor variables can have separate effects on an outcome. They can even interact with each other, such that the effect of one predictor changes as a function of the value of another predictor. This might be a better way of understanding our athlete data - instead of four different categories of training regimens, maybe there is a more general effect of track-training and of weight-training that combine in order to produce someone's running time. Being in the \"both-training\" condition just means being a part of both of these general groups, instead of its own unique category.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the ANOVA approach to statistics, taking into account the effect of multiple grouping variables is called **factorial ANOVA**. Sometimes it is also called something like two-way ANOVA (which means two separate predictor variables) or 2x2 ANOVA (meaning there are two levels in the first predictor and two levels in the second). Like the one-way ANOVA, factorial ANOVA is a method of comparing group means to see if they come from the same population. So a sensible place to start would be to be explicit about a null hypothesis for these means. However, the fact that the different training groups are made of combinations of multiple variables means there are several different means that one might be interested. To see this, letâ€™s start by thinking about all the different sample means that we can calculate for this kind of design: \n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, thereâ€™s the obvious idea that we might be interested in this table of group means for our athletes at their first meet:\n",
    "\n",
    "|                        | No weight training | Weight training | Any weight training |\n",
    "| :--------------------: | :----------------: | :-------------: | :-----------------: |\n",
    "| **No track training**  | 49.071             | 47.323          | 48.047              |\n",
    "| **Track training**     | 48.354             | 47.134          | 47.774              |\n",
    "| **Any track training** | 48.563             | 47.229          | 47.969              |\n",
    "\n",
    "In this table, the number in each cell stands for the group mean with that combination of track training type (row) and weight training type (column). The values in the last row are the means of each weight training group regardless of what type of track training they did. The values in the last column are the means of each track training group regardless of what type of weight training they did - aka the **marginal means**. The bottom right cell holds the Grand Mean, or the mean running time of everyone regardless of their value on any training variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are all group means, which are statistical estimates. That means there are population parameter versions of these values that our estimates came from. We can express our table above with those values instead: \n",

    "|                        | No weight training | Weight training | Any weight training |\n",

    "\n",
    "We have a bunch of $\\mu$ values with different subtexts. $\\mu_{11}$ means the population mean for the group in the first value of track training type and first value of the weight training type. $\\mu_{12}$ would be the population mean for the group in the first value of track training type and second value of the weight training type, and so on. A dot in the notation means any value for that variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have this notation, it is straightforward to formulate and express some null hypotheses. Letâ€™s suppose that the goal is to find out two things: firstly, does track training have any effect on running time? Secondly, does weight training have any effect on running time? Formally, we write down our null hypotheses in terms of the equality of marginal means. We also create a separate null hypothesis for each predictor we are interested in:\n",
    "\n",
    "row means are the same: $H_0: \\mu_{1.} = \\mu_{2.}$\n",
    "\n",
    "column means are the same: $H_0: \\mu_{.1} = \\mu_{.2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is a type of ANOVA, to test these hypotheses we investigate the within and between sum of squares for each of these hypotheses. At this point, this is done the same way as a one-way ANOVA (which, in the case of just two group means like here, also reduces to being the same thing as an independent samples t-test - it's all connected!). The one-way ANOVA is applied for the effect of track training and separately for the effect of weight training. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our dataset, information about athletes' training is also stored in two variables ```track_training``` and ```weight_training```. Try using the ```aov()``` function yourself using the formula ```time ~ track_training + weight_training``` in the dataset ```meet1``` in order to run this factorial ANOVA."

What political party is someone likely to join, whether or not someone is admitted to college, etc. For this example, let's load in a dataset of hospital patients and see how their levels of anemia relate to their appetite:"

    "In these data, values for both of these variables were stored categorically. One *could* imagine recording severity of anemia and strength of appetite as quantitative, but that's not the data we have here. Patients were only coded as having anemia or not, and a good or poor appetite. Thus, we don't have any information about the quantitative difference between these variable levels. They are categorical. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using a regression, t-test, ANOVA, etc. to predict a categorical outcome variable is not appropriate. This is because these models require numeric variation in outcome score values to calculate means, predictions, and residuals. If we built a model for a categorical outcome variable in the same way, our residuals would only ever have two values - correct prediction, or incorrect. The equations for sum of squares would break over this. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we need a different approach. For situations where you have a categorical predictor and categorical outcome, traditional statisticians developed a tool called the **chi-square test**. This test solves our problem of categorical data by reasoning about *probabilities* of certain values, rather than the values themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down how to do this. First, we can see that each person falls into one of four groups - either they have anemia or not, and they have a good appetite or not. We can put the number of people in each of these groups in a table like so, called a **contingency table**: \n",
    "\n",

    "| **Column total**  | 16     | 142       | 158       |\n",
    "\n",
    "This is similar to the means table from our ANOVA example, except now these numbers are group and marginal counts instead of group and marginal means. From these counts, we can calculate what proportion of people in the dataset are in each group. ~4% of the people in this data are anemic with a good appetite (6/158) while 6% are anemic with a bad appetite (10/158). These numbers are small, but that's because not many of our patients are anemic. If we looked at the anemic patients only, 37.5% have a good appetite (6/16) while 62.5% don't (10/16).  \n",
    "\n",
    "If we thought anemia was unrelated to appetite, we might expect some people with anemia to have a good appetite and some to have a poor appetite. Further, we'd expect the *proportion* of people with good/poor appetites to be the same regardless of whether or not someone has anemia. In otherwords, knowing someone's anemia status doesn't change our prediction of how likely they are to have a poor appetite. This is the null hypothesis for a chi-square test. Formally, if P stands for probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H_0: P_{(poor|anemic)} = P_{(poor|not anemic)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, instead we might actually believe that having anemia increases your risk of a poor appetite. In this case, we'd expect the *probability* of having a poor appetite to be different in the anemia condition compared to the no-anemia condition. A $\\chi^2$ or chi-statistic (pronounced \"kai-square\") represents the ratio difference in these probabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "That's what we'd expect from the population of people with anemia and appetites. But of course, our sample is just a subset of the population, so the actual proportions of these values in our data might be slightly different even if the null hypothesis is true. The sampling distribution of $\\chi^2$ looks like so, depending on how many rows and columns in the contingency table that you have (k = (r-1)(c-1)): \n",

    "While 62.5% of anemic patients had a poor appetite, only 6.3% of non-anemic patients did (9/142). Is this a big enough difference in the probability of a poor appetite between the two conditions to consider them to come from different populations? A chi-square test calculates a chi-square statistic for your sample and then finds an associated p-value for how likely it is your sample came from a population with no difference in group probabilities. \n",
