    "# Chapter 4 - Organizing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.1 The structure of data \n",
    "\n",
    "Data can come to us in many forms. If you collect data yourself, you may start out with numbers written on scraps of paper. Or you may get a computer file filled with numbers and words of various sorts, representing many variables at once. \n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have worked with one variable at a time, which is easy to visualize and understand simply by printing its vector. However, most real-world data has many variables stored at once. To manage this, it is necessary to organize and format data so that they are easy to analyze using statistical software. There is no one way to organize data, but there is a way that is most common, and that is what we recommend you use.\n",
    "\n",
    "This common way is called a **dataframe**. Under this framework, data are stored into rectangular tables, with rows and columns. What goes on each row and column follows two principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each column is a variable\n",
    "- Each row is an observation (or, we have been calling it a case or an object to which a measure is attached)\n",
    "- The first row contains the names of all the variables\n",
    "- The data within a dataframe are from the same dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Rectangular tables of this sort are represented in R using new data type - conveniently, called a dataframe. The columns are the variables; this is where the results of measures are kept. The rows are the cases sampled. Each value of different variables that are on the same row belong to the same observation (e.g., the same person, zip code, habitat, etc.) Data frames provide a way to save information such as column headings (i.e., variable names) in the same table as the actual data values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Principle 4 above simply states that the types of observations that form the rows cannot be mixed within a single table. So, for example, you wouldn’t have rows of college students intermixed with rows of cars or countries or couples. If you have a mix of observation types (e.g., students, families, countries), they each go in a different dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.2 Creating a dataframe\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combining vectors\n",
    "Let's say we have two vectors, ```x1 <- c(1,2,3,4,5)``` and ```x2 <- c(18,21,20,23,20)```. We can combine these together into a dataframe using the ```data.frame()``` function."

In this study, 75 hotel housekeepers were either told that their daily work accounted for all the daily exercise they need, or were told nothing. \n",

There are many file formats data can be saved in that are more or less easy to open in various software. Our Mindset Matters data is saved as a .csv, meaning a \"comma-separated value\" format, as this is really easy for computers programs to parse. If you were to open this file in a basic text editor program, you'd see rows are separated on different lines, and columns are separated by commas. In R, the ```readr``` package can understand this format and create a rectangle dataframe for us. \n",

If we save the filtered data to the same dataframe name, it will overwrite the original dataframe. Doing this would mean we can no longer access the data we filtered out. This process is called **destructive editing**. In general, we don't want to do this - we don't want to permanently erase any data. Thus if you're manipulating data in a dataframe, it's usually best to save the manipulated data as a new object. That way you can always access the original data again if needed. "

For instance, it would be difficult to measure school achievement with a grade score from just your English class. However, if you do have multiple measures, you probably will want to combine them into a single variable. In the case of school achievement, a good summary measure might be the average grade earned across all of a student’s courses.\n",

For example, in ```mindsetmatters```, we have a measurement for both someone's weight (```Wt```)  and their BMI score (```BMI```).   We don't know their height, but BMI is a function of weight / height. So, we could divide ```Wt``` by ```BMI``` to make a new variable ```Ht```. \n",
