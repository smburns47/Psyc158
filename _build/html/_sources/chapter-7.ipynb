    "## 7.1 The importance of good visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a historic example of just how important it can be to visualize your data well. On January 28, 1986, the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded 73 seconds after takeoff, killing all 7 of the astronauts on board. As when any such disaster occurs, there was an official investigation into the cause of the accident, which found that an O-ring connecting two sections of the solid rocket booster leaked, resulting in failure of the joint and explosion of the large liquid fuel tank.\n",

    ":align: center\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The investigation found that many aspects of the NASA decision making process were flawed, and focused in particular on a meeting between NASA staff and engineers from Morton Thiokol, a contractor who built the solid rocket boosters. These engineers were particularly concerned because the temperatures were forecast to be very cold on the morning of the launch, and they had data from previous launches showing that performance of the O-rings was compromised at lower temperatures. In a meeting on the evening before the launch, the engineers presented their data to the NASA managers, but were unable to convince them to postpone the launch. Their evidence was a set of hand-written slides showing numbers from various past launches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The visualization expert Edward Tufte has argued that with a proper presentation of all of the data, the engineers could have been much more persuasive. In particular, they could have shown a figure like the one below, which highlights two important facts. First, it shows that the amount of O-ring damage (defined by the amount of erosion and soot found outside the rings after the solid rocket boosters were retrieved from the ocean in previous flights) was closely related to the temperature at takeoff. Second, it shows that the range of forecasted temperatures for the morning of January 28 (shown in the red shaded area) was well outside of the range of all previous launches. While we can’t know for sure, it seems at least plausible that this could have been more persuasive.\n",

    "The goal of plotting data is to present a summary of a dataset in a two-dimensional (or occasionally three-dimensional) presentation. We refer to the dimensions as axes – the horizontal axis is called the X-axis and the vertical axis is called the Y-axis. We can arrange the data along the axes in a way that highlights the data values. These values may be either continuous or categorical.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different types of plots that we can use, which have different advantages and disadvantages. Let’s say that we are interested in characterizing the difference in height between men and women in the ```fingers``` dataset. The figure below shows four different ways to plot these data - some of these we discussed in the last chapter, and one is new.\n",

    "Now we will begin to discuss *why* we should choose to use some of these over others. \n",
    "\n",
    "The bar graph in panel A shows the difference in means, but doesn’t show us how much spread there is in the data around these means – and as we will see later, knowing this is essential to determine whether we think the difference between the groups is large enough to be important.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second panel B shows the bars with all of the data points overlaid - this makes it a bit clearer that the distributions of height for men and women are overlapping, but it’s still hard to see due to the large number of data points focused on one spot. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general we prefer using a plotting technique that provides a clearer view of the distribution of the data points. In panel C, we see one example of a **violin plot**, which plots the distribution of data in each condition (after smoothing it out a bit). Obviously, the name of this plot comes from the fact that it sort of resembles a violin shape. The fatter part of the \"violin\" is where there is more data, the skinnier parts are the tails of the distribution. You can make a plot like this in R using ```gf_violin()```. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another option is the boxplot shown in panel D, which shows the median (central line), a measure of variability (the width of the box, which is based on a measure called the interquartile range), and any outliers (noted by the points at the ends of the lines). Violin plots and boxplots are both effective ways to communicate the central tendency of each group as well as provide a good feel for the distribution of the data.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Rule 1 - Show the data and make them stand out\n",
    "Let’s say that you performed a study that examined the relationship between dental health and time spent flossing, and you would like to visualize the data. The figure below shows four possible presentations of these data.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In panel A, we don’t actually show the data, just a line expressing the relationship between the data. This line implies an explanatory relationship. It says that, for observations that have more flossing, we would expect better dental health. However, this plot is clearly not optimal, because we can’t actually see what the underlying data look like. We don't know if this relationship line actually reflects the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Panels B-D show three possible outcomes from plotting the actual data, where each plot shows a different way that the data might have looked. If we saw the plot in Panel B, we would probably be suspicious – rarely would real data follow such a precise pattern. The data in Panel C, on the other hand, look like real data – they show a general trend, but they are messy, as data in the world usually are. The data in Panel D show us that the apparent relationship between the two variables is solely caused by one individual, who we would refer to as an outlier because they fall so far outside of the pattern of the rest of the group. It should be clear that we probably don’t want to conclude very much from a relationship that is driven by one data point. This figure highlights why it is always important to look at the raw data before putting too much faith in any summary of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a scatterplot of ```Middle``` varying by ```Sex```. The density of the distributions is pretty tight, so with this code it is hard to see all the datapoints. Make at least one change to the plot so that it is easier to see the data points. "

In the plot above, even if you changed it to a jitter plot, changed the point transparency, etc., it might still be hard to see from a glance where the central tendency of each group is, or which group is which. People can probably figure it out by looking harder, but in the real world we want things to be as cognitively easy for our readers as possible. \n",

It's a good rule of thumb that, when you have more than one group of data in a plot, that you change the color of the data to correspond to each group. In addition, if the central tendency is the main summary statistic you care about, choose a plot type that highlights that (such as a violin plot or a boxplot). \n",

For example, let’s say that we are interested in seeing whether rates of violent crime have changed in the US. In the below figure, we can see these data plotted in ways that either make it look like crime has remained constant, or that it has plummeted. The same data can tell two very different stories!\n",

He asserts that one should not spend a lot of empty vertical space trying to reach down to the zero point at the cost of hiding what is going on in the data line itself.\n",

Second, the 3D perspective distorts the relative numbers, such that the pie wedge for Catholic appears much larger than the pie wedge for None, when in fact the number for None is slightly larger (22.8 vs 20.8 percent). Third, by separating the legend from the graphic, it requires the viewer to hold information in their working memory in order to map between the graphic and legend and to conduct many “table look-ups” in order to continuously match the legend labels to the visualization. And finally, it uses text that is far too small, making it impossible to read without zooming in.\n",
