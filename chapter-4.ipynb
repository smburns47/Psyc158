    "# Chapter 4 - Cleaning Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The scientific study of humans is a messy process. They don't always understand what we're asking in a survey, or do what we want them to do in a behavioral study. Some people are nervous of looking a certain way, so will answer questions not as they truly believe but as they want other people to think of them. Other people just want to finish the study as fast as possible and get paid, so they complete tasks without paying much attention. Sometimes, participants don't want to answer a question at all. Other times we the researchers made a mistake in creating the study in the first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these reasons, the preparation of human data for analysis - called **data cleaning** - is an important skill. It is the process of reorganizing a dataset so that it most closely resembles the true values we want to analyze, in a format that works for our chosen analysis process. Data cleaning is also a time consuming process. Analysis of any research study is often 80%+ data cleaning with a much smaller proportion of time dedicated to running models or testing hypotheses. \n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between clean and dirty data can be the difference between a successful research study and noisy data that no one can understand. In this chapter, we will spend time learning the most helpful data cleaning steps for psychological data. "

    "\n",
    "Some research studies are simple to conduct, with just a couple variables recorded. Other studies can be massive endeavors with many variables collected at once for the purpose of several different hypotheses. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the [General Social Survey](https://gss.norc.org/) is a nationally representative survey run every year in the US since 1972. It collects data from hundreds of thousands of people on hundreds of variables, including demographics, behaviors, and attitudes relevant to US society. It has provided data for more than 130 research papers that all studied a different hypothesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "That's a lot of data to manage! For this reason, sometimes you want to focus on viewing only a subset of your variables in a data frame. To continue our use of the ```tetrismemories``` dataset from last chapter, you might care about only the hypothesis regarding different study conditions affecting number of intrusive memories, and thus only the variables ```condition``` and ```instrusive_memories```. The data frame would be easier to read if it only included these variables and not all the others. Let's open up that dataset and see where these variables are. "

That way you can always access the original data again if needed. *Definitely* don't save manipulated data frames as a csv that replaces the original file you loaded the data from, or you won't be able to get it back!  \n",

    "\n",
    "Filtering is very useful for removing data points we don't want, such as the bad outliers and missing values discussed in chapter 2. To remove outliers, we need to decide what counts as realistic values for a variable. There are different opinions on this among researchers. Some believe you should remove any data points that are sufficiently far away from the average of a variable (chapter 5 will discuss ways to calculate this). Other researchers are more conservative and think you should only remove data points if the value is clearly incorrect, like someone mistyping their age as 211 instead of 21. This is an example of a situation where statistics aren't completely objective, and different decisions lead to different analysis outcomes. If you leave outliers in, will your data be too noisy? If you remove many outliers, are you choosing a cut off based on what helps your hypothesis the most? You will have to develop domain knowledge in the topic you are studying in order to be confident that the decision you made on outlier classification is the best decision for your data.  \n",

These values are recorded in the ```pre_sad_rating```, ```pre_hopeless_rating```, ```pre_depressed_rating```, ```pre_fear_rating```, ```pre_horror_rating```, and ```pre_anxious_rating``` (and corresponding variables for the post ratings).

The remaining arguments are mapping specification for which values should turn into which other values, separated by a `~` symbol.

While we are only spending one chapter dedicated to this in this course, you will actually find (maybe to some [frustration](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-state-that-the-majority-of-work-for-a-data-scientist-is-data-cleaning-not-the-machine-learning-part)) that the majority of time you spend on a data file is cleaning, rather than analyzing.

But data cleaning can involve many steps and a lot of time figuring out what cleaning steps you even need to take!\n",
