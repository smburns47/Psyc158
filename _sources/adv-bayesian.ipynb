    "# Chapter 21 - Bayesian Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "## 21.1 Frequentist vs. Bayesian statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "The ideas about inferential statistics in the previous chapters come from the perspective of Frequentist statistics. Almost every textbook for undergraduate psychology students starts with this framework, as the Frequentist view of statistics dominated the academic field of statistics for most of the 20th century and is a popular collection of tools among applied scientists. It was and is the most common practice among psychologists to use Frequentist methods. Because Frequentist methods are ubiquitous in scientific papers, every student of statistics needs to understand those methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Frequentist statistics can be frustrating to interpret. The major tenet of Frequentism is that there is only one state of the world. A hypothesis you are testing is either true, or it is not. We can describe the probability of generating certain datasets given the true state of the world, but if we don't know that state, we can't describe the probability of what that state is given a particular dataset we have collected. Unfortunately, that's usually the case we find ourselves in - we *don't* know the true state of the world, and our only hope to figure it out is by looking at some data. Frequentism thus isn't an ideal method for answering that question, and we have to do some brain bending things to make it work for us anyways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can't figure out the probability of the true population parameter, so we have to think up some hypothetical parameters and see how likely those are to produce our data (p-values)\n",
    "- We then have to reduce these probabilities to a binary yes/no decision about whether we want to accept this hypothetical parameter as being the truth (null hypothesis testing) \n",
    "- We can only ever reject a null hypothesis, but we can never build support for it \n",
    "\n",
    "If these topics have felt abstract and difficult to master, you wouldn't be alone. The convoluted nature of statistical inference with Frequentist methods partially explains errors that can be found in published research. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is why some people prefer a different approach to inferential statistics, called **Bayesian statistics**. These ideas as a collection are named after Thomas Bayes, the mathematician who contributed much to our understanding of probabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian statistics have a fundamentally different view of probability than Frequentist statistics do. In Frequentism, probability means the long-run proportion across many samples. If the true population parameter &beta; is 0, we can't measure it directly, but we can estimate it many times across many samples. This builds a sampling distribution, composed of many b estimates. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/ch15-betadist0.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we sample these b estimates over and over and get different values each time, the b estimates can have probability. There is some proportion of these estimates, across many samples, that will equal a particular value. \n",
    "\n",
    "To a Frequentist, the population parameter &beta; *cannot* have a probability. It is inherently just one value, and it isn't generated by some underlying process. It just is. A population parameter is either equal to a particular value, or it is not. There's no way to get many values of it for measuring a proportion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, in the Bayesian perspective, probability means something different. To a Bayesian, probability is your strength of belief about the population parameter. There is still one population parameter that we don't know, but until we know it there are many possible values is *could* be. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/ch21-beliefdist.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "We can believe more strongly in some possible values than others - one value is more likely to be the truth than another value. In this sense, a population parameter can have a probability. Do we think a &beta; value of 0 is more likely to be the truth than a &beta; value of 10? What value do we believe in most strongly? \n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian statistics is gaining ground among psychologists, so in this chapter we want to expose you to the basics of this approach, as well as contrast how you would use Bayesian statistics for the same use cases we have so far explored with Frequentist statistics. Bayesian statistics as a whole is a large field of study that is most appropriately learned in an entire course, rather than just one chapter in a course. But if these alternate approaches to statistical questions intrigue you more than the Frequentist methods you've already learned, pursuing more study in the area would be a great idea."

    "## 21.2 Conditional probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Thomas Bayes' theorems of probability, and thus all of Bayesian statistics, are based on the idea of **conditional probability**. In chapter 8 we limited ourselves to simple probabilities of one or two elementary events happening. This was the probability of such an event without any context - without other information that might help us narrow down the outputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "A conditional probability is the likelihood of some event, given another event has already happened. It is a bigger picture of likelihood than simple probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take the 2020 US Presidential election as an example. There are two simple probabilities that we could use to describe the electorate. First, we know the probability that a voter in that election was affiliated with the Republican party: P(Republican) = 0.36. We also know the probability that a voter cast their vote in favor of Donald Trump: P(Trump) = 0.47. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted to know the probability that a random voter coming out of a polling place voted for Trump, we might use that simple probability 47% to make a decision. It's not a very helpful probability - essentially flipping a coin. But in truth we rarely make decisions this way - obviously we'd find it more surprising that someone voted for Trump in West LA, California than if they were in Lander County, Nevada. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our instinct is to actually use conditional probabilities. We might expect that people who are Republican are more likely to have voted for Trump than people who are Democrat. Thus, if we already knew a random person was Republican, we might be able to use that information to better inform our decision about whether or not they voted for Trump. The question we now ask is, what is the probability that a person voted for Trump, *given* that they are a Republican?\n",
    "\n",
    "We write the equation for a conditional probability as: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A|B)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which states the probability of A, given B. In our specific example, the probability of voting for Trump given someone is Republican is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(Trump vote|Republican)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The likelihood that any one person voted for Trump is 47%: P(Trump vote) = 0.47. But if we find out that 94% of Republicans voted for Trump, knowing whether or not somone is a Republican would change our guess confidence by a lot. Rather than 0.47, P(Trump vote|Republican) = 0.94. \n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the conditional probability of A, we need to know the joint probability (that is, the probability of both A and B occurring) as well as the overall probability of B. We want to know the probability that both things are true, given that the one being conditioned upon is true. The equation for this is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can calculate conditional probability from data. Let's use an example we're familiar with in the ```studentdata``` dataset. We already know from lots of practice that student sex is related to their thumb length. Let's put this is terms of a conditional probability - what is the probability that someone's thumb is 60mm or longer, *given* that they are male? \n",

    "\n",
    "To compute $P(>=60mm | Male)$, we need to know the joint probability of being male and having a thumb at least as long as 60mm, in addition to the simple probability of being male.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the joint probability, we divide the number of people who are both male and have a long thumb by the total number of people. In our case, that is\n",

If two variables are related to each other like sex and thumb length are, the conditional probability of a particular value on one variable given a value on the other is different than the simple probability of either variable alone. Knowing information about one variable helps us update our beliefs about the probability of the other variable. "

    "## 21.3 Reversing a conditional probability: Bayes' rule\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we know $P(A|B)$, but we really want to know $P(B|A)$. For example in medical screening, we know $P(+test|disease)$ from the test manufacturer, but we want to know $P(disease|+test)$; the probability you are sick given you got a positive test. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thomas Bayes [figured out a mathematical theorem](http://www.hep.upenn.edu/~johnda/Papers/Bayes.pdf) to help us do this. We now call this theorem **Bayes' rule**. To reverse a conditional probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(B|A) = \\frac{P(A|B)*P(B)}{P(A)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's plug in our numbers from the table above to figure out $P(Male | >=60mm)$, rather than $P(>=60mm | Male)$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Does that seem surprising? The probability of having a long thumb given someone was male is pretty high, 74.1%. But the reverse is not automatically true - if someone has a long thumb, the probability that they are also male is only 42.1%. This is because of the **base rate** of sex in our sample - only 29.3% of the participants are male. If we know someone has a long thumb, there is still an overall lower chance that someone is male. However, it's a *higher* chance than if we knew nothing about their thumb length. We changed our probability estimation based on the additional information about thumb length. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to think of Bayes’ rule is as a way to update our beliefs on the basis of data. That is, improving our understanding about the world using data. The different parts of Bayes’ rule have specific names, that relate to their role in using Bayes’ rule to update our beliefs. \n",
    "\n",
    "We start out with an initial guess about the probability of sex ($P(B)$), which we refer to as the **prior probability**. In the example above we'd use the base rate of sex as our prior, since it was our best guess as to the individual’s chance of being male before we knew their thumb length. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then collect some data about a new variable, thumb length. The degree to which thumb length ($A$) is related to sex ($B$) is given by $P(A|B)$, which we refer to as the **likelihood**. This is how likely a long thumb is, given someone is male. \n",
    "\n",
    "The denominator of Bayes' rule ($P(A)$) is referred to as the **marginal likelihood**, because it expresses the overall likelihood of thumb length, averaged across all of the possible values of sex.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The outcome to the left ($P(B|A)$) is referred to as the **posterior probability** - the probability of being male, given a long thumb. This name is because it’s what comes out the back end of the computation, once we've updated our prior probability with additional information.\n",
    "\n",
    "A slightly different way of writing Bayes' rule makes this clearer: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(B|A) = \\frac{P(A|B)}{P(A)}*P(B)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The fraction ($\\frac{P(A|B)}{P(A)}$) tells us how much more or less likely having a long thumb is given being male, relative to the overall (marginal) likelihood of having a long thumb. If it is much more likely that someone will have a long thumb once we know they are male, this fraction value will be a large number. If it is much less likely that someone will have a long thumb once we know they are male, this fraction value will be less than 1. If knowing someone's sex doesn't change the likelihood of a long thumb at all, the fraction value will be equal to 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "The part on the right side ($P(B)$) tells us how likely we thought being male was before we knew anything about thumb length. \n",

    "How do you make a belief about what the effect of ```Sex``` should be, before you've seen any data about it? Good question. There is a lot of debate over the best way to pick the prior. If you have no previous information about an effect and what you think the true effect might be, it's really hard to make guesses about its probability. In this case, researchers can start with what's called an **uninformative prior** or **flat prior**. This is a probability distribution that is constant across all possible values, since we have no information about what values are more likely than others. A uniform distribution would be an uninformative prior - that would be the guess that the true value of $\\beta_1$ has an equal probability of being any value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other times, researchers use a **weakly informative prior**. We use this distribution when we don't know what a likely value of $\\beta_1$ is, but we have some vague sense that certain values are more likely than others. I.e., if $\\beta_1$ in this model is the difference in group means between male and female thumb lengths (mm), something like $\\beta_1 = 4$ is probably more likely than $\\beta_1 = 40$. A normal distribution with a large standard deviation would be an example of this prior. Weakly informative priors are most common to use, and the defaults in most Bayesian software. \n",

In this case, you have strong existing beliefs about what the probability distribution of $\\beta_1$ should be, and you'd choose to use an **informative prior** that is narrow.\n",

    "This prior distribution represents our guesses about what the true population parameter for $\\beta_1$ actually is. It's not an uninformative prior because it's not flat - we think $\\beta_1 = 0$ is more likely to be the truth than $\\beta_1 = 100$. But it's a weakly informative prior because there's a very large range of $\\beta_1$ values that we're considering. In our minds, before seeing any data, $\\beta_1 = 100$ is still possible (if less likely). In addition, because this prior is centered at 0 and covers potential $\\beta_1$ values that are both positive and negative, that means we don't know anything about the direction of the effect - we think a negative effect is just as likely as a positive effect.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The intercept coefficient has a prior probability distribution too. According to the ```prior_summary()``` output, this prior is a normal distribution with mean 60 and SD 23. Even the estimate of the population standard deviation has a prior distribution to describe our beliefs about it (listed under \"Auxilliary (sigma)\"). The shape of that prior distribution is the exponential distribution (sampled with ```rexp()```) since that is the right shape for the sampling distribution of $\\sigma$. \n",

Instead we have to do some linguistic tricks like saying we are 95% *confident* the true population parameter is in this range. \n",

    "\n",
    "But with n=13 and true $\\beta_1 = 0.7$, we would just barely decide it is significant (and only 80% of the time). The confidence interval of our estimate would be something like [0.01, 1.39]. That doesn't overlap with 0, but if we care about the *specific value* of the true population parameter, that confidence interval isn't very helpful. Nearly all possible positive correlation values in the population could reasonably produce a sample estimate of $r=0.7$ with only 13 data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Bayesian statistics, power planning is not about what sample size you need to find a *significant* effect. Instead, it answers what sample size you need to find a *precise* effect. Bayesians do **precision planning**, instead of power planning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Currently there aren't easy-to-use tools in R for doing precision planning. Most people build their own simulations. Below is an example of some code that simulates a Bayesian sample size plan. Specifically, if we wanted to make a posterior estimate of the effect size that is at least as precise as 5mm (the credible interval is no more than 5mm wide), we could draw increasingly larger random samples from the data until we can make a credible interval that is narrow enough. Read through each line of the code and see if you understand what that step is doing. When you run the code, it may take a few moments to do all the simulations but will eventually output a minimum sample size needed to get a posterior interval with a precision of 5mm. "

    "\n",
    "The above use cases describe how to apply Bayesian philosophy to evaluation of individual parameters in a model. We can estimate the likely value of each population parameter in a model, say how precise that estimate is, make sample size decisions for attaining precision, and update beliefs about population parameters based on new data. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a Bayesian method to compare entire models to each other. The method for that involves what are called **Bayes factors**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian estimation tells you the probability that the population parameter equals a particular value, given some data. A Bayes factor is a ratio of the probability that the parameter equals some number I, compared to the probability that the parameters equals some other number J, given the same data: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$Bayes factor = \\frac{P(\\beta=I|b)}{P(\\beta=J|b)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If I has a much higher probability (the Bayes factor ratio is large), then we would say the evidence strongly favors the parameter equalling I instead of J.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We can extend this logic up to many sets of parameters for comparing models. What is the probability that all the parameters in a model are equal to a set of values, compared to the probability they equal a different set of values?\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequently, this question is asked about a null hypothesis where all $\\beta = 0$ vs. some alternative hypothesis where at least some $\\beta \\neq 0$. It uses Bayesian methods to answer the Frequentist concern about the null hypothesis. The plus side to doing this instead of Frequentist model comparison is that it lets you build support for the null hypothesis itself, and allows you to use optional stopping once you've accumulated enough evidence for either hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The package ```BayesFactor``` is an easy way of doing this. All you have to do is fit a model the normal way with the function ```BFlm()```, and it will tell you the Bayes factor in favor of that model having non-zero parameters compared to the null model where all $\\beta = 0$. "
