    "### Qualitative data\n",
    "Data are composed of **variables**. Variables are measurements that, across many values, will vary in some way. For example, human intelligence is a variable because, across many people, we would likely measure different intelligence scores. The values of intelligence would vary person to person. In contrast, human species is *not* a variable, since by definition all humans are *homo sapien.* There's no variation data-point to data-point. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of variables. Some are **qualitative**, meaning that they describe a quality rather than a numeric quantity. For example, say we ran a survey in class that asked “What is your favorite food?” Some of the answers may be: blueberries, chocolate, tamales, pasta, and pizza. Those data are not intrinsically numerical; there's nothing to indicate quantity or numerical relations among them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In R, there are also different types of objects we can rely on to represent different data types. We can represent qualitative data like words or letters with the **character value type**. Remember at the beginning of Chapter 1 when you printed out ```\"hello world!\"```? By putting those words within a set of quotation marks, we created a character-type object. If we forget the quotes, R will think that a word is a name of an object instead of a character value. Note that numbers can also be turned into character values - for example, when 20 is in quotation marks like this – “20” – it will be treated as a character value, even though it includes a number. R doesn’t care whether you use single quotes, ‘like this’, or double quotes, ”like that\". We’ll mostly use double quotes for consistency."

As another example, we might ask people for their political party affiliation, and then code those as numbers: 1 = “Republican”, 2 = “Democrat”, 3 = “Libertarian”, and so on.

    "## 3.5 What makes good data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data are meant to be a clear, quantitative representation of some quality in the world. However, in many fields such as psychology, the thing that we are measuring is not a physical feature, but instead an unobservable theoretical concept, which we usually refer to as a **construct**. For example, let’s say that we want to test how well you understand the distinction between categorical, ordinal, and interval variables. The professor could give you a pop quiz that would ask you several questions about these concepts and count how many you got right. This would be one way to try and measure the construct that is your knowledge. However, constructs are difficult to measure well. There are several things that can get in the way of good measurement:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measurement error \n",
    "\n",
    "It is usually impossible to measure a construct without some amount of error. In the example above, you might know the answer, but you might mis-read the question and get it wrong. In other cases, there is error intrinsic to the thing being measured, such as when we measure how long it takes a person to respond on a simple reaction time test, which will vary from trial to trial for many reasons. We generally want our ***measurement error*** to be as low as possible, which we can achieve either by improving the quality of the measurement (for example, using a better timer to measure reaction time), or by averaging over a larger number of indvidiual measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reliability \n",
    "\n",
    "**Reliability** refers to the consistency of our measurements. One common form of reliability, known as **test-retest reliability**, measures how well the measurements agree if the same measurement is performed twice. For example, someone might give you a questionnaire about your attitude towards statistics today, repeat this same questionnaire tomorrow, and compare your answers on the two days; if the questionnaire is a good measurement of your true attitude, we would hope that they would be very similar to one another, unless something happened in between the two tests that should have changed your view of statistics (like reading this book!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to assess reliability comes in cases where the data include subjective judgments. For example, let’s say that a researcher wants to determine whether a treatment changes how well an autistic child interacts with other children, which is measured by having experts watch the child and rate their interactions with the other children. In this case we would like to make sure that the answers don’t depend on the individual rater — that is, we would like for there to be high **inter-rater reliability**. This can be assessed by having more than one rater perform the rating, and then comparing their ratings to make sure that they agree well with one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reliability is important if we want to compare one measurement to another, because the relationship between two different variables can’t be any stronger than the relationship between either of the variables and itself (i.e., its reliability). This means that an unreliable measure can never have a strong statistical relationship with any other measure. For this reason, researchers developing a new measurement (such as a new survey) will often go to great lengths to establish and improve its reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Validity\n",
    "\n",
    "Reliability is important, but on its own it’s not enough: After all, I could create a perfectly reliable measurement on a personality test by re-coding every answer using the same number, regardless of how the person actually answers. We want our measurements to also be **valid** — that is, we want to make sure that we are actually measuring the construct that we think we are measuring. There are many different types of validity that are commonly discussed; we will focus on three of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Face validity** - Does the measurement make sense on its face? If I were to tell you that I was going to measure a person’s blood pressure by looking at the color of their tongue, you would probably think that this was not a valid measure on its face. On the other hand, using a blood pressure cuff would have face validity. This is usually a first reality check before we dive into more complicated aspects of validity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Construct validity** - Is the measurement related to other measurements in an appropriate way? This is often subdivided into two aspects. **Convergent validity** means that the measurement should be closely related to other measures that are thought to reflect the same construct. Let’s say that I am interested in measuring how extroverted a person is using either a questionnaire or an interview. Convergent validity would be demonstrated if both of these different measurements are closely related to one another. On the other hand, measurements thought to reflect different constructs should be unrelated, known as **divergent validity**. If my theory of personality says that extraversion and conscientiousness are two distinct constructs, then I should also see that my measurements of extraversion are unrelated to measurements of conscientiousness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Predictive validity** - If our measurements are truly valid, then they should also be predictive of other outcomes. For example, let’s say that we think that the psychological trait of sensation seeking (the desire for new experiences) is related to risk taking in the real world. To test for predictive validity of a measurement of sensation seeking, we would test how well scores on the test predict scores on a different survey that measures real-world risk taking.\n",
