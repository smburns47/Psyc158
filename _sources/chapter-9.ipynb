    "# Chapter 9 - Modeling the Data Generation Process\n",
    "\n",
    "In the prior chapter we discussed why a sample of data looks the way it does. One reason is because of the sampling process used and the level of randomness involved, while another reason is the data generation process that led to the shape of the population from which the data came. \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the data generation process is to break down what factors create the distribution of a population, and can therefor explain the shape and variation in that population. If we know the data generation process, we can explain why things happen the way they do and anticipate what new data will look like. Because of this, trying to understand the data generation process is perhaps *the* main reason for using statistics in psychology. The majority of this field is dedicated to studying the data generation process for how the human mind works. Anytime we form a hypothesis about how variables are related to each other (e.g., \"how does income relate to sleep quality?\" or \"are stressed parents more punative than non-stressed parents?\"), we are proposing a data generation process. So this is a concept to pay attention to! In this chapter we will discuss how data analysts build ideas about the data generation process using data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9.1 Models\n",
    "\n",
    "There is how the world works (the data generation process), and there is our idea of it. Our current understanding of the data generation process for some outcome is called a **model**. A model describes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The inputs that go into creating the output\n",
    "2) The relationships among all variables in the process\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, our model of the data generation process accurately captures the truth. Consider a concept like gravity. More than 300 years ago, Isaac Newton described an equation for the gravitational force between two objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$gravitational force = G\\frac{m_1*m_2}{r^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation is a model because it describes both the inputs that determine the value of gravitational force (object masses, the distance between them, and a force parameter G), and it describes the relationships between these inputs and the output (multiply the masses together, divide by the square of the distance, multiply all by G).\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is very accurate. For any two bodies of mass, plugging in the appropriate input values to this model will creat a prediction of gravitational force that matches what actually occurs. Highly accurate models like this, where we fully understand the data generation process and can accurately make predictions of outcomes, are called **deterministic models**. We can *determine* what any output will be just by knowing the input values. "

    "Deterministic models can be really useful for making predictions. Say you have a good model of how disease spreads through a population, such as the influential [SIR model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology) used in epidemiology. This model outputs the number of people likely to contract a disease as a function of the number of susceptible people (S), infectious people (I), people already recovered (R), and rates for infection and recovery. Using this model, public health officials can predict the trajectory of a disease over time. Based on this prediction, they can then make other decisions like whether or not the government should institute more stringent disease avoidance protocols. This SIR model was the basis for the [\"flatten the curve\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flattening_the_curve) messaging at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. It predicted that with social distancing practices, the pandemic would be longer but the number of people sick at any one time would be lower and hospitals wouldn't be overwhelmed.  \n",

    "Unfortunately for us as psychologists (and also much of the social and life sciences), we rarely get to work with deterministic models. As complex as the math seems in many physics problems or the SIR model above, it is only possible to come up with that math in the first place because the data generation processes are relatively simple. When it comes to human thought and behavior, there are so many inputs and relationships among them that we have only begun to scratch the surface of the data generation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a well-studied psychological phenomenon, like the [Stroop Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect). This effect is highly replicable and strong - switching up the color in which a color-word is written in greatly slows down how fast people process the word and choose the right answer. Word-color congruence is a variable that explains variation in reaction time. But even if this effect is well-documented, it's only one part of the data generation process of the outcome variable. What else goes into determining exactly how fast someone will select a word from a list? Their reading speed? Font size? Hand-eye coordination? How big of an effect is the Stroop Effect relative to these other inputs, and how do they relate to each other? Could you build an equation for reaction time? \n",
    "\n",
    "From this example, you can see how we don't actually know that much about what exactly determines a fairly basic behavior - selecting a word quickly. Just imagine how much additional work we'd have to do to deterministically model something more complex, like political behaviors.   \n",
    "\n",
    "However, this doesn't mean we can't model psychological processes at all. But it does mean we have to relax our standards a bit of what a model is. In this case, we can build a **conceptual model**. In a conceptual model, we don't know the perfect equation for determining an output. But we have 1) some idea of what some of the inputs are, and 2) an idea about what variables are related to each other, in some way. \n",
    "\n",
    "While we don't have enough information in a conceptual model to make an equation like in a deterministic model, it is often helpful to draw out what information we do have. For example, here is a possible conceptual model of the data generation process for the Stroop Effect discussed above. This kind of illustration is called a **path diagram**. \n",

    "\n",
    "Maybe our idea of the data generation process for reaction time is more detailed than this. Maybe we also think that there are relationships among the inputs themselves (e.g., font size could influence someone's natural reading speed). In addition, we might think some inputs are more important than others for determining reaction time, such that the effect of the inputs could be strong, medium, or weak.

Your model could be very basic (one input related to an output) or highly detailed, but it's important to make your model explicit so you understand what you're trying to study.  "

    "\n",
    "Our goal in research is often to take a conceptual model and try to move it closer to being a deterministic model - to learn more information about the data generation process so we can use it to make better predictions and inferences about the population. While a deterministic model is built by knowing all relevant information about the inputs and relationships among them, a conceptual model has no concrete information about those things, just some guesses. To bridge the gap, we could come up with a simplified equation that describes part of the data generation process, or at least what it looks like within a subsample of data we are able to collect. For example, an attempt at an equation for the Stroop Effect might look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$reaction time_i = \\beta_1congruence_i + \\beta_2speed_i + \\beta_3font_i + \\beta_4coordination_i$$\n",

    "Here, each input is included and the strength of the effect for each input is a numeric value encoded as a $\\beta$ parameter. Once we have a model like this, if we have a congruence, speed, font, and coordination value for some data point i, we can predict a reaction time value that is hopefully pretty close to what that value would really be.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is another way models are useful. If we have multiple ideas of what the data generation process may be (i.e., hypotheses), we can generate some data based on them. Afterwards, we can compare to real data we collected to see how well our predictions match reality. We can even tweak our model to figure out which values of the inputs will produce the most accurate predictions. A simple model developed this way, based on fitting to real-world data, is called a **statistical model**. \n",

    "The heart of inferential statistics is building statistical models, so we will now spend the rest of the semester creating them and evaluating the ones we've build. However, before we start, there is something really important to keep in mind about statistical models: all statistical models are wrong! At least, wrong by some amount. These are *simplfied* equations, that contain some (but unlikely all) of the inputs and basic (but probably overly basic) relationships among all the variables. This is an attempt to approximate what the true data generation process is in the population, but we are very unlikely to get it exactly right since we almost always have only a sample of data to compare it to. If we use the above equation to predict values of reaction time, our predictions will probably be different from true reaction times values by a bit. Therefor, if we wanted to write the equation for the true data generation process, we could write something like this: \n",

    "$$DATA = MODEL + ERROR$$\n",

    "Building a statistical model is the process of choosing what variables should go into the MODEL portion of that equation. Building a *good* statistical model is the process of minimizing how much error is unaccounted for by our model.

    "Let's now dive into building our own statistical models! But rather than a big long equation like the proposed model above, let's start with the simplest kind a statistical model we can build. At its most basic level, a statistical model can be thought of as an equation that produces a predicted score for each observation in a dataset. What is the simplest possible equation you could write? \n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest models we could consider generates the same predicted score for every observation in a variable, no matter its real value.

However, this kind of super basic statistical model is actually very useful because it serves as a baseline to compare our later statistical models to. This baseline model that always makes the same prediction is called the **null model** or the **empty model**. This is because there are no predictor variables in it. \n",

For a quantitative variable whose distribution is roughly normal, a number right in the middle (the mean) might be the best null model. Remember, we aren’t saying that such a simple model is a good model. We're simply establishing a baseline prediction to make for the outcome variable when we don't know anything about the data generation process. In a normal distribution, the mean is the most commonly-occuring value, so that is the safest prediction to make in the absense of any other information. If a distribution is skewed left or right, the best null model might be the median instead. For a categorical variable, the best null model is generally the category that is most frequent (the mode).\n",

    "This is where the \"error\" term of a model comes in: once we choose a number to model a distribution, we can think of the variation around that number as error. It is the stuff we're missing that would be needed to adjust what we're predicting into what the actual value is. As we can see above, a one-number model for a distribution with less spread seems to have less error, and thus a better fit, than a one-number model for a distribution with more spread. The reason for this is that the error around the model is greater for the distribution with more spread. \n",

But if we take this model and look backwards at the data we have already collected, we can also generate a “predicted” thumb length for each of the data points we already have. This prediction answers the question: what would our model have predicted this thumb length to be if we hadn’t collected the data?\n",

We will go into this a lot more in the next chapter, but for now, the reason is so we can get a sense of just how wrong our automatically generated statistical model is. The value of everyone's thumb lengths isn't actually 62, so we want to know how far each of our data points are from the prediction that our model would have made.

Knowing this helps us infer knowledge about how the world works and make predictions for new data. Usually we don't know the data generation process, but we can use data to help us build statistical models that approximate it. \n",

This is because we're likely not including all pieces of the puzzle that is the data generation process. In addition, like when we simulated data last chapter, sometimes a sample of data can look different from the population from which it came because of the forces of randomness.\n",

    "Within our data sample, we can calculate the exact mean of the distribution, and the exact size of the errors. When we do this, we are calculating a **statistic**. A statistic is anything you can compute to summarize something about your data; the mean is one example of a statistic, the standard deviation is another.\n",
