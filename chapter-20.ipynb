    "In the example of male and female thumb lengths, each data point represents the thumb length of one individual person. These datapoints are known as **independent** because one person having a length of 60mm doesn't influence the thumb length of a separate person. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not all datapoints are independent, however. Imagine a separate case where we have a dataset of test scores for every student in a class, where they took four different versions of the test. The test has been used for many years, so we know the underlying *population* of scores has a mean of 80 and a standard deviation of 10. The data generation process of this test is going to make a score of 80 more typical than a score of 98. \n",
    "\n",
    "But when drawing a sample of test scores for *each student*, they're not sampling randomly from the population of scores. Some students are better at studying than others, so their scores tend to be higher. Other students have a heavy courseload, so their scores are more variable depending on if they had to spend a lot of time studying for a test in another class as well. Thus, each test score for a particular student is *not* independent - it *depends* on which student it came from. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, you can imagine a student as their own data generation process. Their mean is drawn from the overall population of students, but scores within each student are drawn from that student's particular population of scores. This is illustrated in the graph below. \n",

But as we just talked about, we know this is not the case.

Each student is independent of each other, but within one student their scores are not independent.\n",

If we were to treat it as independent data, our model would run fine and we could make predictions - but we would be building those predictions from a dataset where we thought we had 30 independent datapoints, rather than 15 pairs of dependent points. We'd be assuming there were more degrees of freedom than there truly were, and our confidence in our predictions would be biased. \n",

If our hypothesis is that the studying technique we taught the students would improve their scores, we would expect the mean of post scores to be higher than the mean of before scores. In other words, that there was an *increase* in scores. So instead of using each specific score in the model, we could model the *change* in each person's test scores:"
